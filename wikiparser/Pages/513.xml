The '''Battle of Bukit Timah''' (10&amp;ndash;12 February 1942), was part of the final stage of the [[Empire of Japan]]'s [[Battle of Singapore|invasion]] of [[Singapore]] during [[World War II]].

==Battle==
On 8 February 1942, the Japanese landed a large force on the western side of Singapore Island. Throughout the following days, further troops were landed and heavy fighting followed as they pushed the mainly Australian defenders from the [[22nd Brigade (Australia)|22nd Brigade]] back from their positions on the coast. On 10 February further landings were made against the northern positions occupied by the [[27th Brigade (Australia)|27th Brigade]] between the River Kranji and the Causeway, and steadily the British and Commonwealth lines were pushed back south-east towards the centre of the island.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1998|pp=202&amp;ndash;203}}

As the Japanese began advancing towards the strategically important Bukit Timah which offered vital supplies including water, British, Indian, and Australian troops from a variety of units fought actions along the [[Bukit Timah Road]] in an effort to blunt the advance. As the Japanese 5th Division, with armoured support, advanced down the Choa Chu Kang Road, British troops and Chinese volunteers from the irregular [[Dalforce]] engaged in desperate hand-to-hand fighting, but being poorly equipped, they were forced back and by midnight the Japanese had occupied Bukit Timah.&lt;ref name="singapore1942" &gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319004403/http://www.s1942.org.sg/s1942/dir_defence5c1.htm |url=http://www.s1942.org.sg/s1942/dir_defence5c1.htm |title=Battle of Bukit Timah |work=1942: Battlefield Singapore |archivedate=19 March 2009 |accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February, two British brigades attempted a counter-attack, but this was turned back; the following day, the [[Imperial Guard (Japan)|Japanese Imperial Guards]], outflanked the British positions from the north, and forced them to withdraw. Dalforce was engaged in further fighting, which resulted in heavy Japanese casualties; in revenge the Japanese killed a large number of Chinese civilians nearby after the fighting.&lt;ref name="singapore1942" /&gt;
