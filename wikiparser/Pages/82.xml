The '''Battle of Korytsa''' was fought during the [[Greco-Italian War]] of 1940–41 in the town of [[Korçë]] (Greek: ''Korytsa'') in southern [[Albania]] between the defending [[Ninth Army (Italy)|Italian 9th Army]] and the attacking [[III Army Corps (Greece)|Greek III Army Corps]].

After the initial Italian invasion starting 28 October had been stopped, Greek forces launched an counter-offensive in early November. The battle for Korytsa formed the first part of the operation against the Italians and marked the final stage of the Greek penetration in the [[Battle of Morava–Ivan]] heights sector.

The Italian 9th Army was entrenched around the town, but fierce fighting over two days led to the break-through of the Italian defensive line by the Greeks and its capture. Remnants of the 9th Army itself avoided capture, as the opposing Greek forces were poorly motorized and unable to pursue the retreating Italians.
