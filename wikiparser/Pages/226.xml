The '''Battle of Clervaux''' or the '''Battle for Clervaux'''&lt;ref name= "Parker1991" /&gt; (in English sources, Clervaux is occasionally called by the German name '''Clerf''')&lt;ref name= "Sayen2007" /&gt; was an opening engagement of the [[Battle of the Bulge]] that took place in the town of [[Clervaux]] in northern [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref name="Quigley2004" /&gt; It lasted from December 16 to 18, 1944.&lt;ref name = "Quigley2004"/&gt; German forces encircled numerically inferior American forces, primarily from the 110th Regiment and the 109th Field Artillery Battalion, and quickly forced them to surrender. The battle has been referred to as the Luxembourg "[[Alamo]]".&lt;ref name="McDonald2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parker2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacDonald1997"/&gt;

Clervaux was the first [[tank]] battle of the Ardennes offensive and ended in total disaster for the Americans, who permanently lost nearly 60 tanks while the Germans lost only four.{{sfn|Bergström|2014|p=97}} The U.S. 707th Tank Battalion was wiped out, losing 46 tanks destroyed and six damaged out of 34 [[M4 Sherman]] [[medium tank|medium]] and 18 [[M3 Stuart]] [[light tank]]s.{{sfn|Bergström|2014|p=97}} U.S. [[infantry]]men lacked morale and unit cohesion, with the force at Clervaux surrendering at the first sight of German tanks and only 100 troops out of an entire regiment offering serious resistance.{{sfn|Bergström|2014|p=96}}

== Background ==
Striking at 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Saturday, 16 December, the Germans achieved almost total surprise in breaking through Allied lines, beginning what is commonly called the Battle of the Bulge. The German goal was to separate the American forces from the British and Canadian forces, and take the important port city of [[Antwerp]].  By late afternoon the Germans had 14 divisions operating in the Ardennes, but the number would swell to an estimated 25 divisions with 600 tanks and 1,000 aircraft.&lt;ref name= "Eisenhower (1986), 557"/&gt; The U.S. [[106th Infantry Division (United States)|106th Division]], located in the most exposed positions along the corps line, and the [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Division]] took the brunt of the attack. The 106th was later described as being "newly arrived and unpracticed", while the 28th had recently suffered heavy casualties in fighting to clear enemy forces from the [[Hürtgen Forest]].&lt;ref name="Hastings2005"/&gt; For their part, the German forces were hampered by a lack of adequate preparatory reconnaissance. There was also a mismatch between the quality of their armored and [[SS]] formations, which fought well, and that of their regular infantry units, which consisted largely of poorly trained and poorly motivated replacements.&lt;ref name="Hastings2005"/&gt; 

== Prelude ==
[[Major General]] [[Troy H. Middleton]], headquartered in [[Bastogne]], was awakened by a guard and could hear the guns from there. Throughout the day, the 106th was able to hold its position, but additional German units poured in during the night. Much of the 106th was on the German side of the [[Our River]] in an area known as the [[Schnee Eifel]]. The division's commander, Major General [[Alan W. Jones|Alan Jones]], concerned about his two regiments east of the river, called Middleton. The conversation was interrupted by another call and then resumed. At the end of the conversation Middleton told an aide that he had given his approval to have the two regiments pull back to the west side of the river. Jones, on the other hand was convinced that Middleton had directed these units to stay and was further convinced of this by a written order from earlier in the day but just received.&lt;ref name="MacDonald, 128-9"/&gt; As a result of the miscommunication, the pullback did not occur and the two regiments were ultimately surrounded with most of the men captured on 17 December.&lt;ref name = "Price, 215-16"/&gt; While two of the 28th Division's regiments survived the German onslaught intact, and were able to inflict significant losses on German infantry formations,&lt;ref name="Hastings2005"/&gt; the 110th Regiment, commanded by Colonel [[Hurley Fuller]], was directly in the path of the massive advance.&lt;ref name = "Publishing2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold1990-40"/&gt;

German forces of the [[5th Panzer Army|Fifth Panzer Army]] under [[Hasso von Manteuffel]]'s command, primarily from the [[2nd Panzer Division]], [[116th Panzer Division]] and the [[126th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|126th Infantry Division]] (another account suggests the 2nd Panzer, [[Panzer Lehr Division]] and the [[26th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|26th Volksgrenadier Division]])&lt;ref name = "Sayen2007" /&gt; attacked the American 110th Regiment from the [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Division]] on December 16.&lt;ref name= "Publishing2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CollinsKing2011"/&gt; The 110th's regimental headquarters, and most of its strength, were in the town of [[Clervaux]].&lt;ref name="Arnold1990-40"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Arnold1990-48" /&gt; The unit also received support from a tank company from the [[9th Armored Division (United States)|9th Armored Division]]&lt;ref name="Arnold1990-48"/&gt; as well from the 103rd Engineer Battalion under Captain Parrett, and 109th Field Artillery Battalion under Lt. Col. Robert E. Ewing.&lt;ref name ="Publishing2005"/&gt; Despite this support, German forces had significant superiority in the region, and the engagement was described as a "couple of infantry companies and one company of light tanks versus substantial elements of an entire panzer corps."&lt;ref name="Arnold1990-48"/&gt; Fuller described the opposing forces as "two Panzer divisions and one infantry division."&lt;ref name="Publishing2005"/&gt; Bergström identified the U.S. defenders of Clervaux as the 110th Regimental Combat Team, 707th Tank Battalion, the 630th Tank Destroyer Battalion and a tank company from the 2nd Tank Battalion.{{sfn|Bergström|2014|p=96}}

==Battle==
{{quote box|quote= ''The attack by the light tank company of the 707th along the Skyline Drive was disastrous. About 0720 the company crossed into the 110th Infantry zone, where the ground rose away from the highway and forced the tanks to advance in column on the road. As the column emerged from the village of [[Heinerscheid]], concealed high-velocity guns opened on the skimpily armored light tanks, picking them off like clay pipes in a shooting gallery. Eight tanks were knocked out by the enemy gunners and in the confusion three more fell prey to bazooka fire. The entire action lasted ten minutes.''|source=—[[Hugh M. Cole]],&lt;br&gt; ''[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Ardennes:_Battle_of_the_Bulge/Chapter_VIII The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge]'', [[United States Army in World War II]], p 188.|width=30%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

At 09:30 on the 17th, the 2nd Panzer Division attacked Clervaux, with six German [[Sturmgeschütz III|Stug III]]s from a ''[[Panzerjäger]]'' company and [[Panzergrenadier]]s in thirty armored vehicles advancing from the south. They were repulsed by five [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]]s from the 707th Tank Battalion, which knocked out two Stug IIIs, while losing three Shermans themselves.{{sfn|Bergström|2014|pp=96-97}} The burning vehicles blocked any further German progress along the narrow road. The Germans then detoured by attacking the northern part of the U.S. position. Their attack was a complete success as the Sherman tanks of the 2nd Tank Battalion, supported by some anti-tank guns of the 630th Tank Destroyer Battalion, were no match for two platoons of [[Panzer IV]]s from Panzer-Regiment 3.{{sfn|Bergström|2014|p=97}} The Americans lost fourteen Shermans and most of their crews.{{sfn|Bergström|2014|p=98}} 

In the evening, a company from Panzergrenadier-Regiment 2 quickly secured the railway station and bridge north of town, capturing both objectives from the surprised Americans.{{sfn|Bergström|2014|p=96}} Panzer IVs were radioed and they raced to the center of the town from the north, guns blazing, and most American soldiers in the town promptly surrendered. The bridge south of town was captured.{{sfn|Bergström|2014|pp=97-98}} Fuller requested permission to withdraw from Major General [[Norman Cota]], the commander of the 28th Infantry Division, but was denied.&lt;ref name="Arnold1990-48"/&gt; Some 100 American defenders still held [[Clervaux Castle]].{{sfn|Bergström|2014|p=97}}&lt;ref name= "Sayen2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CollinsKing2011" /&gt; Finally, on the morning of the 18th, the American troops under Captain Clark Mackey, commander of the 110th's Headquarters Company, and Captain John Aiken, out of ammunition and with the castle on fire, surrendered to the Germans as the German tanks broke into the castle compound.&lt;ref name= "CollinsKing2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold1990-48"/&gt; Some troops made it out of Clervaux but many, like Colonel Fuller, were taken prisoner before they reached the Allied lines.&lt;ref name="Sayen2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Price, 221-2"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Though the 110th Regiment and the 109th Field Artillery Battalion were shattered, the stubborn resistance offered by them and other VIII Corps units greatly slowed the German timetable.&lt;ref name="Publishing2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Price, 221-2"/&gt; The 110th lost 2,750 men during the first days of the Ardennes battle, but how many of these were lost at Clervaux remains unknown.{{sfn|Bergström|2014|p=98}} The 630th Tank Destroyer Battalion lost 30 out of 36 [[anti-tank gun]]s on 17 December, most at Clervaux.{{sfn|Bergström|2014|p=98}}
