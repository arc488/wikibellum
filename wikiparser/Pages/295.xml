&lt;!-- Remember to be neutral per WP:NEUTRAL and add verifiable, reliable sources per WP:VERIFY! --&gt;The '''Continuation War''' was a conflict fought by [[Finland]] and [[Nazi Germany]], as [[Co-belligerence|co-belligerents]], against the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) from 1941 to 1944, during [[World War II]].{{refn|{{lang-fi|jatkosota}}; {{lang-sv|fortsättningskriget}}; {{lang-de|Fortsetzungskrieg}}. According to Finnish historian Olli Vehviläinen, the term 'Continuation War' was created at the start of the conflict by the Finnish government, to justify the invasion to the population as a continuation of the defensive [[Winter War]] and separate from the German war effort. He titled the chapter addressing the issue in his book as "Finland's War of Retaliation". Vehviläinen asserted that the reality of this claim changed when the Finnish forces crossed the 1939 frontier and started annexation operations.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=91}} The US Library of Congress catalogue also lists the variants '''War of Retribution''' and '''War of Continuation''' (see authority control).|group="Note"}} In Russian historiography, the war is called the '''Soviet–Finnish Front of the Great Patriotic War'''.{{refn|{{lang-ru|Советско-финский фронт Великой Отечественной войны}}. Alternatively the '''Soviet–Finnish War 1941–1944''' ({{lang-ru|Советско–финская война 1941–1944|links=no}}).&lt;ref name="SovEncyclo"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Great Soviet Encyclopedia|last=|first=|publisher=MacMillan Publishing Company|year=1974|isbn=0028800109|location=|pages=|chapter=Finland}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} Germany regarded its operations in the region as part of its overall war efforts on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and provided Finland with critical material support and military assistance.

The following paragraph contains a bundle of cites for the Finnish participation in the Siege of Leningrad, which is a commonly debated complex issue in the article (see talk). --&gt;
The Continuation War began 15 months after the end of the [[Winter War]], also fought between Finland and the USSR. There have been numerous reasons proposed for the Finnish decision to invade, with regaining territory lost during the Winter War being regarded as the most common. Other justifications for the conflict included President [[Risto Ryti|Ryti]]'s vision of a [[Greater Finland]] and Commander-in-Chief [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Mannerheim]]'s desire to retake [[Karelia]]. Plans for the attack were developed jointly between the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' and a faction of Finnish political and military leaders with the rest of the government remaining ignorant. Despite the co-operation in this conflict, Finland never formally signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] that had established the Axis powers and justified its alliance with Germany as self-defence.

In June 1941, with the start of the German [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]], the Finnish Defence Forces launched their offensive following Soviet airstrikes. By September 1941, Finland had reversed its post–Winter War concessions to the Soviet Union by retaking the [[Finnish reconquest of the Karelian Isthmus (1941)|Karelian Isthmus]] and [[Finnish reconquest of Ladoga Karelia (1941)|Ladoga Karelia]]. However, the Finnish Army continued the offensive past the pre-1939 border with the [[Finnish invasion of East Karelia (1941)|conquest of East Karelia]], including [[Petrozavodsk]], as well as halting only around {{Convert|30-32|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the centre of [[Leningrad]], where they participated in [[Siege of Leningrad|besieging the city]] by cutting its northern supply routes and digging in until 1944.{{refn|See the relevant section and the following sources:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.ch/books/about/The_Siege_of_Leningrad_Epic_of_Survival.html?id=p3FAAAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |title=The Siege of Leningrad: Epic of Survival|last=Wykes|first=Alan|publisher=Ballantine Books |year=1968 |isbn=9780356029580|location=|pages=9–21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The World War II Desk Reference |last=Brinkley |first=Douglas |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2004 |isbn=9780060526511 |location= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/worldwariideskre00brin/page/210 210] |url=https://archive.org/details/worldwariideskre00brin/page/210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Baryshnikov|2002|p=}}{{sfn|Salisbury|2003|p=246|ps=: "This line was only twenty miles from the Leningrad city limits."}}&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/battleforleningr00glan/page/416|title=The Battle for Leningrad: 1941–1944|last=Glantz|first=David M.|date=2002|publisher=University Press of Kansas|isbn=9780700612086|pages=[https://archive.org/details/battleforleningr00glan/page/416 416]|language=en|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=_oHRAwAAQBAJ|title=Combat and Genocide on the Eastern Front: The German Infantry's War, 1941–1944 |last=Rutherford|first=Jeff|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107055711|pages=190|language=en|quote=The ensnaring of Leningrad between the German and Finnish armies did not end the combat in the region as the Soviets launched repeated and desperate attempts to regain contact with the city.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227153427/https://books.google.ch/books?id=_oHRAwAAQBAJ |archivedate=27 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=8iQuDwAAQBAJ|title=Leningrad 1941–42: Morality in a City under Siege |last=Yarov |first=Sergey|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|others=Foreword by John Barber|year=2017|isbn=9781509508020|pages=7|language=en|quote=While the exact number who died during the siege by the German and Finnish armies from 8 September 1941 to 27 January 1944 will never be known, available data point to 900,000 civilian deaths, over half a million of whom died in the winter of 1941–2 alone.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227153547/https://books.google.ch/books?id=8iQuDwAAQBAJ|archivedate=27 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Note"}} In [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], joint German–Finnish forces [[Operation Silver Fox|failed to capture]] [[Murmansk]] or cut the Kirov (Murmansk) Railway, a transit route for [[Lend-Lease|lend-lease]] equipment to the USSR. The conflict stabilised with only minor skirmishes until the tide of the war turned against the Germans and the Soviet Union's strategic [[Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive]] in June 1944. The attack drove the Finns from most of the territories they had gained during the war, but the Finnish Army halted the offensive in August 1944.

Hostilities between Finland and the USSR ended with a ceasefire, which was called on 5 September 1944, formalised by the signing of the [[Moscow Armistice]] on 19 September 1944. One of the conditions of this agreement was the expulsion, or disarming, of any German troops in Finnish territory, which led to the [[Lapland War]] between the former co-belligerents. World War II was concluded formally for Finland and the minor Axis powers with the signing of the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Peace Treaties]] in 1947. The treaties resulted in the restoration of borders per the 1940 [[Moscow Peace Treaty]], the ceding of the municipality of [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] ({{Lang-ru|Pechengsky raion}}) and the leasing of [[Porkkalanniemi|Porkkala Peninsula]] to the USSR. Furthermore, Finland was required to pay [[United States dollar|$]]300 million in [[Finnish war reparations to the Soviet Union|war reparations to the USSR]].

63,200 Finns and 23,200 Germans died or went missing during the war in addition to 158,000 and 60,400 wounded, respectively. Estimates of dead or missing Soviets range from 250,000 to 305,000 while 575,000 have been estimated to have been wounded or fallen sick.

==Background==

===Winter War===
{{Main|Winter War|Interim Peace}}
On 23 August 1939, the Soviet Union (USSR) and Germany signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], in which the two parties agreed to divide the independent countries of Finland, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Polish Second Republic|Poland]], and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] into [[spheres of interest]], with Finland falling within the Soviet sphere.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=30}} One week later, Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], leading to the United Kingdom and [[French Third Republic|France]] declaring war on Germany. The Soviet Union [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded eastern Poland]] on 17 September.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=31}} Moscow turned its attention to the [[Baltic states]], demanding that they allow Soviet military bases to be established and troops stationed on their soil. The Baltic governments [[Background of the occupation and annexation of the Baltic states|acquiesced to these demands]] and signed agreements in September and October.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=33}}

[[File:Finnish flag at half-mast interim peace Helsinki 1940.jpg|thumb|left|Finnish flags at [[half-mast]] in Helsinki on 13 March 1940 after the Moscow Peace Treaty became public]]

In October 1939, the Soviet Union attempted to negotiate with Finland to cede Finnish territory on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] and the islands of the [[Gulf of Finland]], and to establish a Soviet military base near the Finnish capital of [[Helsinki]].{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=39}} The Finnish government refused, and the [[Red Army]] invaded Finland on 30 November 1939.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=44}} The USSR was expelled from the [[League of Nations]] and was condemned by the international community for the illegal attack.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=49}} [[Foreign support in the Winter War|Foreign support for Finland]] was promised, but very little actual help materialised, except from Sweden.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=65}} The [[Moscow Peace Treaty (1940)|Moscow Peace Treaty]] concluded the 105-day Winter War on 13 March 1940 and started the [[Interim Peace]].{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=69}} By the terms of the treaty, Finland ceded 11 percent of its national territory and 13 percent of its economic capacity to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=215}} Some 420,000 evacuees were resettled from the ceded territories.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=75}} Finland avoided total conquest of the country by the Soviet Union and retained its sovereignty.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=70}}

Prior to the war, Finnish foreign policy had been based on [[multilateralism|multilateral]] guarantees of support from the League of Nations and [[Nordic countries]], but this policy was considered a failure.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=74}} After the war, Finnish public opinion favored the reconquest of [[Finnish Karelia]]. The government declared national defence to be its first priority, and military expenditure rose to nearly half of public spending. Finland purchased and received donations of war materiel during and immediately after the Winter War.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=75}} Likewise, Finnish leadership wanted to preserve the [[Spirit of the Winter War|spirit of unanimity]] that was felt throughout the country during the Winter War. The divisive [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guard]] tradition of the [[Finnish Civil War]]'s 16 May victory-day celebration was therefore discontinued.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=76}}

The Soviet Union had received the [[Hanko Naval Base]], on Finland's southern coast near the capital Helsinki, where it deployed over 30,000 Soviet military personnel.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=75}} Relations between Finland and the Soviet Union remained strained after the signing of the one-sided peace treaty, and there were disputes regarding the implementation of the treaty. Finland sought security against further territorial depredations by the USSR and proposed [[Mutual Defense Treaty|mutual defence agreements]] with [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], but these initiatives were quashed by Moscow.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=77}}{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=216}}

===German and Soviet expansion in Europe===
{{see also|Germany–Soviet Union relations before 1941}}
[[File:Spb 06-2017 img02 Spit of Vasilievsky Island.jpg|thumb|[[Vasilyevsky Island|Vasilievsky Island]] of St. Petersburg, pictured in 2017. During the Winter and Continuation Wars, Leningrad, as it was then known, was of strategic importance to both sides.]]
After the Winter War, Germany was viewed with distrust by the Finnish, as it was considered an ally of the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, the [[Finnish Government|Finnish government]] sought to restore diplomatic relations with Germany, but also continued its Western-orientated policy and negotiated a war trade agreement with the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=77}} The agreement was renounced after the [[Operation Weserübung|German invasion of Denmark and Norway]] on 9 April 1940 resulted in the UK cutting all trade and traffic communications with the Nordic countries. With the [[Battle of France|fall of France]], a Western orientation was no longer considered a viable option in Finnish foreign policy.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=78}} On 15 and 16 June, the Soviet Union [[Occupation of the Baltic states|occupied the Baltic states]] without resistance and Soviet [[Puppet state|puppet regimes]] were installed. Within two months Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were incorporated into the USSR as Soviet republics and by mid-1940, the two remaining northern democracies, Finland and Sweden, were encircled by the hostile states of Germany and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=79}}

On 23 June, shortly after the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states began, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] contacted the Finnish government demanding that a mining licence be issued to the USSR for the nickel mines in the municipality of [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] ({{lang-ru|Pechengsky raion}}) or, alternatively, permit the establishment of a joint Soviet-Finnish company to operate there. A licence to mine the deposit had already been granted to a British-Canadian company, and the demand was rejected by Finland. The following month, the Soviets demanded that Finland destroy the fortifications on the [[Åland islands]] and grant the USSR the right to use Finnish railways to transport Soviet troops to the newly-acquired Soviet base at Hanko. The Finns very reluctantly agreed to these demands.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=80}} On 24 July, Molotov accused the Finnish government of persecuting the [[Finland – Soviet Union Peace and Friendship Society]], a pro-communist group, and soon afterwards publicly declared support for the group. The society organised demonstrations in Finland, some of which turned into riots.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=81}}{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=218}}

Russian sources, such as the book ''[[Stalin's Missed Chance]]'', maintain that Soviet policies leading up to the Continuation War were best explained as defensive measures by offensive means. The Soviet division of occupied Poland with Germany, the Soviet [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|occupations of Lithuania]], [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940|Latvia]] and [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], and the Soviet invasion of Finland in the Winter War are described as elements in the Soviet construction of a security zone, or buffer region, against the perceived threat from the [[capitalism|capitalist]] powers of Western Europe. The Russian sources see the post-World War II establishment of Soviet [[satellite state]]s in the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries and the [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948]] as the culmination of the Soviet defence plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baryshnikov|first=Vladimir N.|date=2002|title=Проблема обеспечения безопасности Ленинграда с севера в свете осуществления советского военного планирования 1932–1941 гг|trans-title=The problem of ensuring the security of Leningrad from the north in the light of the implementation of the Soviet military planning of 1932–1941|url=http://www.aroundspb.ru/finnish/baryshnikov/pvp1932.php|journal=St. Petersburg and the Countries of Northern Europe|language=ru|publisher=Russian Christian Humanitarian Academy|location=St. Petersburg|quote=The actual war with Finland began first of all due to unresolved issues in Leningrad's security from the north and Moscow's concerns for the perspective of Finland's politics.

===Relations between Finland, Germany and the USSR===
{{Main|Operation Barbarossa}}

On 31 July 1940, German Chancellor [[Adolf Hitler]] gave the order to plan an assault on the Soviet Union, meaning Germany had to reassess its position regarding both Finland and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]. Until then, Germany had rejected Finnish appeals to purchase arms, but with the prospect of an invasion of Russia, this policy was reversed, and in August the secret sale of weapons to Finland was permitted.{{sfn|Reiter|2009|p=132|pp=}} Military authorities signed an agreement on 12 September, and an official exchange of diplomatic notes was sent on 22 September. At the same time, German troops were [[Transit of German troops through Scandinavia (World War II)|allowed to transit]] through Sweden and Finland.{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=220}} This change in policy meant Germany had effectively redrawn the border of the German and Soviet spheres of influence, violating the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=83}}

In response to this new situation, Molotov visited Berlin on 12–13 November 1940.{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=219}} He requested that Germany withdraw its troops from Finland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2020-06-22|title=The Real Lessons of the 75th Anniversary of World War II|url=https://nationalinterest.org/print/feature/vladimir-putin-real-lessons-75th-anniversary-world-war-ii-162982|quote=And on November 25 the Soviet leadership called it a day altogether by officially putting forward to Berlin the conditions that were unacceptable to the Nazis, including the withdrawal of German troops from Finland, mutual assistance treaty between Bulgaria and the USSR, and a number of others.|author=Vladimir Putin|date=2020-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stop enabling Finnish anti-Soviet sentiments. He also reminded the Germans of the 1939 Soviet–German non-aggression pact. Hitler inquired how the USSR planned to settle the "Finnish question", to which Molotov responded that it would mirror the events in [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina|Bessarabia]] and the Baltic states. Hitler rejected this course of action.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=84}} In December, the Soviet Union, Germany and the UK all voiced opinions concerning suitable Finnish presidential candidates. Risto Ryti was the sole candidate not objected to by any of the three powers and was elected on 19 December.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=85}}

In January 1941, Moscow demanded Finland relinquish control of the Petsamo mining area to the Soviets, but Finland, emboldened by a rebuilt defence force and German support, rejected the proposition.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=85}} On 18 December 1940, Hitler officially approved Operation Barbarossa, paving the way for the German invasion of the Soviet Union,{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=221}} in which he expected both Finland and Romania to participate.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=86}} During this period, Finnish Major General [[Paavo Talvela]] met with German {{Lang|de|Generaloberst}} [[Franz Halder]] and {{Lang|de|Reichsmarschall}} [[Hermann Göring]] in Berlin. This was the first time the Germans had advised the Finnish government, in carefully couched diplomatic terms, that they were preparing for war with the Soviet Union. Outlines of the actual plan were revealed in January 1941 and regular contact between Finnish and German military leaders began in February.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=86}}

In the late spring of 1941, the USSR made a number of goodwill gestures to prevent Finland from completely falling under German influence. Ambassador [[Ivan Zotov]] was replaced with the more flexible [[Pavel Orlov (diplomat)|Pavel Orlov]]. Furthermore, the Soviet government announced that it no longer opposed a rapprochement between Finland and Sweden. These conciliatory measures, however, did not have any effect on Finnish policy.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=87}} Finland wished to re-enter World War&amp;nbsp;II mainly because of the Soviet invasion of Finland during the Winter War, which had taken place after Finnish intentions of relying on the League of Nations and Nordic neutrality to avoid conflicts had failed from lack of outside support.{{sfn|Lunde|2011|p=9}} Finland primarily aimed to reverse its territorial losses from the March 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty and, depending on the success of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, to possibly expand its borders, especially into [[East Karelia]]. Some right-wing groups, such as the [[Academic Karelia Society]], supported a [[Greater Finland]] ideology.{{sfn|Jokipii|1999|pp=145–146}}

===German and Finnish war plans===
The matter of when and why Finland prepared for war is still somewhat opaque. Historian [[William R. Trotter]] stated that "it has so far proven impossible to pinpoint the exact date on which Finland was taken into confidence about Operation Barbarossa" and that "neither the Finns nor the Germans were entirely candid with one another as to their national aims and methods. In any case, the step from contingency planning to actual operations, when it came, was little more than a formality."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Frozen Hell: The Russo-Finnish Winter War of 1939–1940|url=https://archive.org/details/frozenhellrussof00trot|url-access=limited|last=Trotter|first=Willian R.|publisher=Algonquin Books|year=1991|isbn=978-1565122499|location=|page=[https://archive.org/details/frozenhellrussof00trot/page/n226 226]|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inner circle of Finnish leadership, led by Ryti and Mannerheim, actively planned joint operations with Germany under a veil of ambiguous neutrality and without formal agreements, after an alliance with Sweden proved fruitless—according to a meta-analysis by Finnish historian [[Olli Vehviläinen]]. He likewise refuted the so-called "driftwood theory" that Finland was merely a piece of driftwood swept uncontrollably in the rapids of great-power politics. Even then, most historians conclude that Finland did not have any realistic alternatives to cooperating with Germany at the time.{{Sfn|Zeiler|DuBois|2012|pp=208–221}} On 20 May, the Germans invited a number of Finnish officers to discuss the coordination of Operation Barbarossa. The participants met on 25–28 May in [[Salzburg]] and Berlin, and continued their meeting in Helsinki from 3 to 6 June. They agreed upon the arrival of German troops, Finnish mobilization, and a general division of operations.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=87}} They also agreed that the Finnish Army would start [[mobilization]] on 15 June, but the Germans did not reveal the actual date of the assault. The Finnish decisions were made by the inner circle of political and military leaders, without the knowledge of the rest of the government, who were not informed until 9 June that mobilization of [[reservist]]s, due to tensions between Germany and the Soviet Union, would be required.{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=221}}{{sfn|Reiter|2009|pp=135–136, 138}}

Finland never signed the [[Tripartite Pact]], which had been signed by all ''de jure'' Axis powers. The Finnish leadership and Mannerheim, in particular, clearly stated they would fight against the Soviets only to the extent necessary to redress the balance of the 1940 treaty. For Hitler, the distinction was irrelevant, as he saw Finland as an ally.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=102}}

The [[Northern Front (Soviet Union)|Northern Front]] ({{lang-ru|Северный фронт|links=no}}) of the [[Leningrad Military District]] was commanded by Lieutenant General [[Markian Popov]] and numbered around 450,000 soldiers in 18 divisions and 40 independent battalions in the Finnish region.&lt;ref name="Krivosheev" /&gt; During the Interim Peace, the Soviet Military had relaid operational plans to conquer Finland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=EYA4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT133&amp;dq=finnish+leningrad+start&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwioqsWPnbnZAhXFhrQKHVEUB6EQ6AEIVTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=finnish%20leningrad%20start&amp;f=false|title=The Chief Culprit: Stalin's Grand Design to Start World War II|last=Suvorov|first=Viktor|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2013|isbn=9781612512686|pages=133|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222225732/https://books.google.ch/books?id=EYA4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT133&amp;dq=finnish+leningrad+start&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwioqsWPnbnZAhXFhrQKHVEUB6EQ6AEIVTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=finnish%20leningrad%20start&amp;f=false|archivedate=22 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with Operation Barbarossa, the USSR required its best units and latest materiel to be deployed against the Germans, and thus abandoned plans for a renewed offensive against Finland.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=91}}{{Sfn|Kinnunen|Kivimäki|2011|pp=153–154}} The [[23rd Army (Soviet Union)|23rd Army]] was deployed in the Karelian Isthmus, the [[7th Army (Soviet Union)|7th Army]] to Ladoga Karelia and the [[14th Army (Soviet Union)|14th Army]] to the [[Murmansk]]–[[Salla]] area of Lapland. The Northern Front also commanded eight [[Aviation Division|aviation divisions]].{{sfn|Kirchubel|2013|pp=114–115}} As the initial German strike against the [[Soviet Air Forces]] had not affected air units located near Finland, it could deploy around 700 aircraft supported by a number of [[Soviet Navy]] wings.{{sfn|Jokipii|1999|p=301}} The [[Baltic Fleet|Red Banner Baltic Fleet]] comprised 2 battleships, 2 light cruisers, 47 destroyers or large torpedo boats, 75 submarines, over 200 smaller craft as well as hundreds of aircraft—and outnumbered the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''.{{sfn|Kirchubel|2013|p=151}}

===Finnish and German===
{{Main||Finnish Army|German Army (1935–1945)}}
The Finnish Army ({{Lang-fi|Maavoimat}}) mobilised between 475,000 and 500,000 soldiers in 14 divisions and 3 brigades for the invasion, commanded by Field Marshal ({{Lang|fi|sotamarsalkka}}) Mannerheim. The army was organised as follows:{{Sfn|Kinnunen|Kivimäki|2011|pp=153–154}}{{sfn|Kirchubel|2013|pp=120–121}}{{sfn|Ziemke|2002|p=9}}
* II Corps ({{Lang|fi|II Armeijakunta}}, {{Lang|fi|II AK}}) and IV Corps: deployed to the Karelian Isthmus and comprised seven infantry divisions and one brigade.
* [[Army of Karelia]]: deployed north of Lake Ladoga and commanded by General [[Erik Heinrichs]]. It comprised VI Corps, VII Corps and Group Oinonen; a total of seven divisions, including the German 163rd Infantry Division, and three brigades.
* 14th Division: deployed in the [[Kainuu]] region, commanded directly by [[Defence Command (Finland)|Finnish Headquarters]] ({{Lang|fi|Päämaja}}).

Although initially deployed for a static defence, the Finnish Army was to later launch an attack to the south, on both sides of Lake Ladoga, putting pressure on Leningrad and thus supporting the advance of the German [[Army Group North]].{{sfn|Ziemke|2002|p=9}} Finnish intelligence had overestimated the strength of the Red Army, when in fact it was numerically inferior to Finnish forces at various points along the border.{{Sfn|Kinnunen|Kivimäki|2011|pp=153-154}} The army, especially its artillery, was stronger than it had been during the Winter War but included only one armoured battalion and had a general lack of motorised transportation.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=90}} The [[Finnish Air Force]] ({{Lang|fi|Ilmavoimat}}) had 235 aircraft in July 1941 and 384 by September 1944, despite losses. Even with the increase in aircraft, the air force was constantly outnumbered by the Soviets.{{Sfn|Kinnunen|Kivimäki|2011|p=168}}{{Sfn|Nenye|Munter|Wirtanen|Birks|2016|p=339}}

The [[Army of Norway (Wehrmacht)|Army of Norway]], or {{Lang|de|AOK Norwegen}}, comprising four divisions totaling 67,000 German soldiers, held the arctic front, which stretched approximately {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} through Finnish Lapland. This army would also be tasked with striking Murmansk and the [[Kirov Railway|Kirov (Murmansk) Railway]] during [[Operation Silver Fox]]. The Army of Norway was under the direct command of the ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' ({{lang|de|OKH}}) and was organised into [[Mountain Corps Norway]] and [[XXXVI Mountain Corps (Wehrmacht)|XXXVI Mountain Corps]] with the Finnish [[Finnish III Corps (Continuation War)|Finnish III Corps]] and 14th Division attached to it.{{sfn|Kirchubel|2013|p=120-121}}{{sfn|Ziemke|2002|p=9}}{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=90}} The ''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'' ({{lang|de|OKL}}) assigned 60 aircraft from ''[[Luftflotte 5]]'' (Air Fleet 5) to provide air support to the Army of Norway and the Finnish Army, in addition to its main responsibility of defending Norwegian air space.{{sfn|Ziemke|2002|p=10}}{{sfn|Ziemke|2015|pp=149-151}} In contrast to the front in Finland, a total of 149 divisions and 3,050,000 soldiers were deployed for the rest of Operation Barbarossa.{{sfn|Ziemke|2002|pp=7, 9}}

==Finnish offensive phase in 1941==
===Initial operations===
[[File:JR45 crossing Murmansk railway.jpg|thumb|270px|Finnish soldiers crossing the [[Kirov Railway|Murmansk railway]] in 1941]]
In the evening of 21 June 1941, German mine-layers hiding in the [[Archipelago Sea]] deployed two large minefields across the Gulf of Finland. Later that night, German bombers flew along the gulf to Leningrad, mining the harbour and the river [[Neva]], making a refueling stop at [[Utti]], Finland, on the return leg. In the early hours of 22 June, Finnish forces launched [[Operation Kilpapurjehdus]] ("Regatta"), deploying troops in the demilitarised [[Åland Islands]]. Although the 1921 [[Åland convention]] had clauses allowing Finland to defend the islands in the event of an attack, the coordination of this operation with the German invasion and the arrest of the Soviet consulate staff stationed on the islands, meant that the deployment was a deliberate violation of the treaty, according to Finnish historian [[Mauno Jokipii]].{{sfn|Jokipii|1999|p=282}}

On the morning of 22 June [[Adolf Hitler]]'s proclamation read: "Together with their Finnish comrades in arms the heroes from Narvik stand at the edge of the Arctic Ocean. German troops under command of the conqueror of Norway, and the Finnish freedom fighters under their Marshal's command, are protecting Finnish territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jScDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hitler's Arctic War: The German Campaigns in Norway, Finland and the USSR 1940-1945|last=Mann|first=Chris|last2=Jrgensen|first2=Christer|date=2016-11-30|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=9781473884595|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the launch of [[Operation Barbarossa]] at around 3:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 22 June 1941, the Soviet Union sent seven bombers on a retaliatory airstrike into Finland, hitting targets at 6:06&amp;nbsp;a.m. Helsinki time as reported by the [[Finnish coastal defence ship Väinämöinen|Finnish coastal defence ship ''Väinämöinen'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digi.narc.fi/digi/view.ka?kuid=3615109|title=Scan from the coastal defence ship Väinämöinen's log book|last=|first=|date=1941-06-22|website=Digital Archive of the National Archives of Finland|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 25 June, the Soviet Union launched another air offensive, with 460 fighters and bombers targeting 19 airfields in Finland, however inaccurate intelligence and poor bombing accuracy resulted in several raids hitting Finnish cities, or municipalities, causing considerable damage. 23 Soviet bombers were lost in this strike while the Finnish forces lost no aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kohtalokkaat lennot 1939–1944|last1=Hyvönen|first1=Jaakko|publisher=Apali Oy|year=2001|isbn=9525026213|location=|pages=|language=Finnish|trans-title=Fateful Flights 1939–1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/hazanov_db2/07.html|title=1941.

The Finnish [[II Corps (Continuation War)|II Corps]] started its offensive in the north of the Karelian Isthmus on 31 July.{{sfn|Lunde|2011|pp=167–172}} Other Finnish forces reached the shores of Lake Ladoga on 9 August, encircling most of the three defending Soviet divisions on the northwestern coast of the lake in a [[Pocket (military)|pocket]] (''[[Pocket (military)#Motti|motti]]'' in Finnish); these divisions were later evacuated across the lake.

The Soviet order to withdraw came too late, resulting in significant losses in materiel, although most of the troops were later evacuated via the [[Beryozovye Islands|Koivisto Islands]]. After suffering severe losses, the Soviet 23rd Army was unable to halt the offensive, and by 2 September the Finnish Army had reached the old [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Finnish)|1939 border]]. The advance by Finnish and German forces split the Soviet Northern Front into the [[Leningrad Front]] and the [[Karelian Front]].

The Finnish Army of Karelia started its attack in East Karelia towards [[Petrozavodsk]], [[Lake Onega]] and the [[Svir River]] on 9 September. German Army Group North advanced from the south of Leningrad towards the Svir River and captured [[Tikhvin]] but were forced to retreat to the [[Volkhov River]] by Soviet counterattacks. Soviet forces repeatedly attempted to expel the Finns from their [[bridgehead]] south of the Svir during October and December but were repulsed; Soviet units attacked the German [[163rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|163rd Infantry Division]] in October 1941, which was operating under Finnish command across the Svir, but failed to dislodge it.{{sfn|Raunio|Kilin|2008|pp=10–11}} Despite these failed attacks, the Finnish attack in East Karelia had been blunted and their advance had halted by 6 December.

===Operation Silver Fox in Lapland and Lend-Lease to Murmansk===
{{See also|Operation Silver Fox|Lend-Lease}}
[[File:Warriors of Lapland.jpg|thumb|left|A Finnish soldier with a [[reindeer]] in Lapland. Reindeer were used in many capacities, such as pulling supply sleighs in snowy conditions.]]

The German objective in Finnish Lapland was to take Murmansk and cut the Kirov (Murmansk) Railway running from Murmansk to Leningrad by capturing Salla and [[Kandalaksha]]. Murmansk was the only year-round [[Port#Warm-water port|ice-free port]] in the north and a threat to the [[nickel]] mine at Petsamo. The joint Finnish–German Operation Silver Fox ({{lang-de|Unternehmen Silberfuchs}}; {{lang-fi|operaatio Hopeakettu|links=no}}) was started on 29 June 1941 by the German Army of Norway, which had the [[Finnish 3rd Division (Continuation War)|Finnish 3rd]] and [[Finnish 6th Division (Continuation War)|6th Divisions]] under its command, against the defending Soviet 14th Army and [[54th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|54th Rifle Division]]. By November, the operation had stalled {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Kirov Railway due to unacclimatised German troops, heavy Soviet resistance, poor terrain, arctic weather and diplomatic pressure by the United States on the Finns regarding the lend-lease deliveries to Murmansk. The offensive and its three sub-operations failed to achieve their objectives. Both sides dug in and the arctic theatre remained stable, excluding minor skirmishes, until the Soviet [[Petsamo–Kirkenes Offensive]] in October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|Jörgensen|2002|pp=81–97, 199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=95}}

The crucial [[Arctic convoys of World War II|arctic lend-lease convoys]] from the US and the UK via Murmansk and Kirov Railway to the bulk of the Soviet forces continued throughout World War II. The US supplied almost [[United States dollar|$]]11 billion in materials: 400,000 jeeps and trucks; 12,000 armored vehicles (including 7,000 tanks, which could equip some 20 US armoured divisions); 11,400 aircraft; and {{convert|1.75|e6ST|e6t|abbr=unit|order=flip}} of food.{{sfn|Weeks|2004|p=9}}{{sfn|Stewart|2010|p=158}} As a similar example, British shipments of Matilda, Valentine and Tetrarch tanks accounted for only 6 percent of total Soviet tank production, but over 25 percent of medium and heavy tanks produced for the Red Army.{{sfn|Suprun|1997|p=35}}

===Aspirations, war effort and international relations===

[[File:Continuation War 1941.jpg|thumb|Finnish soldiers crossing the 1940-agreed border ([[Moscow Peace Treaty]]) at [[Tohmajärvi]] on 12 July 1941, two days after the invasion started]]

The ''Wehrmacht'' rapidly advanced deep into Soviet territory early in the Operation Barbarossa campaign, leading the Finnish government to believe that Germany would defeat the Soviet Union quickly.{{sfn|Reiter|2009|pp=135–136, 138}} President Ryti envisioned a Greater Finland, where Finland and other [[Baltic Finns|Finnic people]] would live inside a "natural defence borderline" by incorporating the [[Kola Peninsula]], East Karelia and perhaps even northern [[Ingria]]. In public, the proposed frontier was introduced with the slogan "short border, long peace".{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=92}}{{sfn|Reiter|2009|pp=135–136, 138}}{{Sfn|Zeiler|DuBois|2012|pp=208–221}} Some members of the Finnish Parliament, such as members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] and the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland|Swedish People's Party]], opposed the idea, arguing that maintaining the 1939 frontier would be enough.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=92}} Finnish Commander-in-Chief, Field Marshal C.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;E. Mannerheim, often called the war an anti-Communist crusade, hoping to defeat "Bolshevism once and for all".{{sfn|Reiter|2009|pp=135–136, 138}} On 10 July, Mannerheim drafted his order of the day, the [[Sword Scabbard Declaration]], in which he pledged to liberate Karelia; in December 1941 in private letters, he made known his doubts of the need to push beyond the previous borders.{{sfn|Clements|2012|p=210}} The Finnish government assured the United States that it was unaware of the order.{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=224}}

According to Vehviläinen, most Finns thought that the scope of the new offensive was only to regain what had been taken in the Winter War. He further stated that the term 'Continuation War' was created at the start of the conflict by the Finnish government to justify the invasion to the population as a continuation of the defensive Winter War. The government also wished to emphasise that it was not an official ally of Germany, but a 'co-belligerent' fighting against a common enemy and with purely Finnish aims. Vehviläinen wrote that the authenticity of the government's claim changed when the Finnish Army crossed the old frontier of 1939 and began to annex Soviet territory.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|pp=89–91}} British author [[Jonathan Clements]] asserted that by December 1941, Finnish soldiers had started questioning whether they were fighting a war of national defence or foreign conquest.{{sfn|Clements|2012|pp=210–211}}

By the autumn of 1941, the Finnish military leadership started to doubt Germany's capability to finish the war quickly. The Finnish Defence Forces suffered relatively severe losses during their advance, and, overall, German victory became uncertain as German troops were [[Battle of Moscow|halted near Moscow]]. German troops in northern Finland faced circumstances they were unprepared for and failed to reach their targets. As the front lines stabilised, Finland attempted to start peace negotiations with the USSR.{{sfn|Jutikkala|Pirinen|1988|p=248}} Mannerheim refused to assault Leningrad and inextricably tie Finland to Germany, regarding his objectives for the war to be achieved, a decision which angered the Germans.{{sfn|Clements|2012|p=210}}

[[File:Soviet POW and a puppy.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet prisoners of war and a puppy pictured in August 1941 at Lupasalmi ({{Lang-ru|Лубосалма|links=no}}) in Karelia]]

Due to the war effort, the Finnish economy suffered from a lack of labour, as well as food shortages and increased prices. To combat this, the Finnish government demobilised part of the army to prevent industrial and agricultural production from collapsing.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=96}} In October, Finland informed Germany that it would need {{convert|159000|t|ST|lk=on|abbr=on}} of grain to manage until next year's harvest. The German authorities would have rejected the request, but Hitler himself agreed. Annual grain deliveries of {{convert|180000|t|ST|abbr=on}} equaled almost half of the Finnish domestic crop. In November, Finland joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]].{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=101}}

Finland maintained good relations with a number of other Western powers. Foreign volunteers from Sweden and Estonia were among the foreigners who joined Finnish ranks; [[Finnish Infantry Regiment 200|Infantry Regiment 200]], called {{Lang|et|soomepoisid}} ("Finnish boys"), mostly comprised Estonians, while the Swedes mustered the [[Swedish Volunteer Battalion]].{{sfn|Jowett|Snodgrass|2012|pp=29–31}} The Finnish government stressed that Finland was fighting as a [[co-belligerent]] with Germany against the USSR only to protect itself and that it was still the same democratic country as it had been in the Winter War.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=96}} For example, Finland maintained diplomatic relations with the exiled Norwegian government and more than once criticised German occupation policy in Norway.{{snf|Ziemke|2015|p=379}} Relations between Finland and the United States were more complex; the US public was sympathetic to the "brave little democracy" and had anti-communist sentiments. At first, the United States sympathised with the Finnish cause, but the situation became problematic after the Finnish Army crossed the 1939 border.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=98}} Finnish and German troops were a threat to the Kirov Railway and the northern supply line between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=98}} On 25 October 1941, the US demanded that Finland cease all hostilities against the USSR and withdraw behind the 1939 border. In public, President Ryti rejected the demands, but in private, he wrote to Mannerheim on 5 November asking him to halt the offensive. Mannerheim agreed and secretly instructed General [[Hjalmar Siilasvuo]] and his III Corps to end the assault on the Kirov Railway.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=99}}

===British declaration of war and action in the Arctic Ocean===
{{See also|Arctic convoys of World War II}}
On 12 July 1941, the United Kingdom signed an agreement of joint action with the Soviet Union. Under German pressure, Finland closed the British [[legation]] in Helsinki, cutting diplomatic relations with Britain on 1&amp;nbsp;August.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=97}} The most sizeable British action on Finnish soil was the [[Raid on Kirkenes and Petsamo]], an aircraft-carrier strike on German and Finnish ships on 31 July 1941.

===Unconventional warfare and military operations===
{{Main|Soviet partisans in Finland}}
[[File:Continuation War 1942 and Soviet assaults English.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The Soviets conducted four attacks in the first half of 1942, all of which were repelled by Finnish–German defenders]]

Unconventional warfare was fought in both the Finnish and Soviet wildernesses. Finnish [[long-range reconnaissance patrol]]s, organised both by the [[Intelligence Division (Finland)|Intelligence Division]]'s [[Erillinen Pataljoona 4|Detached Battalion 4]] and by local units, patrolled behind Soviet lines. [[Soviet partisans]], both resistance fighters and regular long-range patrol detachments, conducted a number of operations in Finland and in [[Eastern Karelia]] from 1941 to 1944. In summer 1942, the USSR formed the 1st Partisan Brigade. The unit was 'partisan' in name only, as it was essentially 600 men and women on long-range patrol intended to disrupt Finnish operations. The 1st Partisan Brigade was able to infiltrate beyond Finnish patrol lines, but was intercepted, and rendered ineffective, in August 1942 at [[Lake Segozero]].&lt;ref name="tikkanen"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tikkanen |first1=Pentti, H. |title=Sissiprikaatin tuho |trans-title=Destruction of the Partisan Brigade |language=Finnish |year=1973 |publisher=Arvi A.

Between 1942 and 1943, military operations were limited, although the front did see some action. In January 1942, the Soviet Karelian Front attempted to retake [[Medvezhyegorsk]] ({{Lang-fi|Karhumäki|links=no}}), which had been lost to the Finns in late 1941. With the arrival of spring in April, Soviet forces went on the offensive on the Svir River front, in the [[Kestenga]] ({{Lang|fi|Kiestinki}}) region further north in Lapland as well as in the far north at Petsamo with the [[14th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|14th Rifle Division]]'s amphibious landings supported by the [[Northern Fleet]]. All Soviet offensives started promisingly, but due either to the Soviets overextending their lines or stubborn defensive resistance, the offensives were repulsed. After Finnish and German counterattacks in Kestenga, the front lines were generally stalemated. In September 1942, the USSR attacked again at Medvezhyegorsk, but despite five days of fighting, the Soviets only managed to push the Finnish lines back {{convert|500|m|yd|abbr=on}} on a roughly {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}}-long stretch of the front.

The 150 speedboats, 2 minelayers and 4 steamships of the [[Finnish Ladoga Naval Detachment]], as well as numerous shore batteries, had been stationed on Lake Ladoga since August 1941. Finnish Lieutenant General Paavo Talvela proposed on 17 May 1942 to create a joint Finnish–German–Italian unit on the lake to disrupt Soviet supply convoys to Leningrad. The unit was named [[Naval Detachment K]] and comprised four Italian [[MAS (motorboat)|MAS torpedo motorboats]] of the [[XII Squadriglia MAS]], four German KM-type minelayers and the Finnish [[Sisu-class motor torpedo boat|torpedo-motorboat ''Sisu'']]. The detachment began operations on August 1942 and sank numerous smaller Soviet watercraft and flatboats and assaulted enemy bases and beach fronts until it was dissolved in the winter of 1942–43.&lt;ref name="MAS"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=xXkpDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT123&amp;dq=naval+detachment+k+italy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2zqLL0bbZAhXD_KQKHeHoCr0Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=naval%20detachment%20k%20italy&amp;f=false|title=Decima Flottiglia MAS: The Best Commandos of the Second World War|last=Zapotoczny Jr.|first=Walter S.|publisher=Fonthill Media|year=2017|isbn=9781625451132|pages=123|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221161614/https://books.google.ch/books?id=xXkpDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT123&amp;dq=naval+detachment+k+italy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2zqLL0bbZAhXD_KQKHeHoCr0Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=naval%20detachment%20k%20italy&amp;f=false|archivedate=21 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-three [[Siebel ferry|Siebel ferries]] and nine infantry transports of the German ''[[Einsatzstab Fähre Ost]]'' were also deployed to Lake Ladoga and unsuccessfully assaulted the island of Sukho, which protected the main supply route to Leningrad, on October 1942.{{sfn|Kiljanen|1968|page=}}

Despite the siege of the city, the Soviet Baltic Fleet was still able to operate from Leningrad. The Finnish Navy's flagship {{Ship|Finnish coastal defence ship|Ilmarinen|4=2}} had been sunk in September 1941 in the gulf by mines during the failed diversionary [[Operation Nordwind (1941)]].{{Sfn|Nenye|Munter|Wirtanen|Birks|2016|pp=136–138}} In early 1942, Soviet forces recaptured the island of [[Gogland]], but lost it and the [[Bolshoy Tyuters]] islands to Finnish forces later in spring 1942. During the winter between 1941 and 1942, the Soviet Baltic Fleet decided to use their large submarine fleet in offensive operations. Though initial submarine operations in the summer of 1942 were successful, the {{Lang|de|Kriegsmarine}} and [[Finnish Navy]] soon intensified their anti-submarine efforts, making Soviet submarine operations later in 1942 costly. The underwater offensive carried out by the Soviets convinced the Germans to lay [[anti-submarine net]]s as well as supporting minefields between Porkkala Peninsula and [[Naissaar]], which proved to be an insurmountable obstacle for Soviet submarines.{{sfn|Kiljanen|1968|page=123}} On the [[Arctic Ocean]], [[Finnish Defence Intelligence Agency|Finnish radio intelligence]] intercepted Allied messages on supply convoys to Murmansk, such as [[Convoy PQ 17|PQ 17]] and [[Convoy PQ 18|PQ 18]], and relayed the information to the ''[[Abwehr]]'', German intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ahtokari|first1=Reijo|last2=Pale|first2=Erkki|title=Suomen radiotiedustelu 1927–1944|trans-title=Finnish radio intelligence 1927–1944|location=Helsinki|publisher=Hakapaino Oy|pages=191–198|isbn=952909437X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 July 1941, the Finns created a military administration in occupied East Karelia with the goal of preparing the region for eventual incorporation into Finland. The Finns aimed to [[ethnic cleansing|expel]] the Russian portion of the local population (constituting to about a half), who were deemed "non-national",{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=225}} from the area once the war was over,{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=105}} and replace them with the local Finnic peoples, such as [[Karelians]], [[Finns]], [[Estonians]], [[Ingrian Finns|Ingrians]] and [[Vepsians]]. Most of the East Karelian population had already been evacuated before the Finnish forces arrived, but about 85,000 people — mostly elderly, women and children — were left behind, less than half of whom were Karelians. A significant number of civilians, almost 30 percent of the remaining Russians, were interned in concentration camps.{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=225}}

[[File:Finland Administrative map 1942 1944.png|thumb|Administrative map of Finland and occupied territories 1942–1944]]

The winter between 1941 and 1942 was particularly harsh for the Finnish urban population due to poor harvests and a shortage of agricultural labourers.{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=225}} However, conditions were much worse for Russians in Finnish concentration camps. More than 3,500 people died, mostly from [[starvation]], amounting to 13.8 per cent of those detained, while the corresponding figure for the free population of the occupied territories was 2.6 per cent, and 1.4 per cent for Finland.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=107}} Conditions gradually improved, ethnic discrimination in wage levels and food rations was terminated, and new schools were established for the Russian-speaking population the following year, after Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim called for the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] from Geneva to inspect the camps.{{sfn|Kirby|2006|p=226}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haavikko|1999|pp=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the occupation, mortality rates had dropped to the same levels as in Finland.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|p=107}}

===Jews in Finland===
{{Main|Jews in Finland}}

Finland had a small [[Jewish]] population of approximately 2,300 people, of whom 300 were refugees. They had full civil rights and fought with other Finns in the ranks of the Finnish Army. The field synagogue in East Karelia was one of the very few functioning synagogues on the Axis side during the war. There were several cases of Jewish officers of the Finnish Army being awarded the German [[Iron Cross]], which they declined. German soldiers were treated by Jewish medical officers—who sometimes saved the soldiers' lives.&lt;ref name="Rautkallio"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rautkallio|first=Hannu|title=Suomen juutalaisten aseveljeys|trans-title=Brotherhood-in-Arms of the Finnish Jews|publisher=Tammi|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Tuulikki|last=Vuonokari|year=2003|title=Jews in Finland During the Second World War|journal=Finnish Institutions Research Paper|publisher=University of Tampere| url=http://www.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/HIST/tv-jews.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214226/http://www15.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/HIST/tv-jews.html|archivedate=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/art-2000005407665.html|title=Lauantaiessee: Miten on mahdollista, että natsi-Saksa palkitsi suomenjuutalaisia rautaristillä jatkosodassa?|last=Petäjä|first=Jukka|date=2017-10-14|work=Helsingin Sanomat|access-date=2018-11-01|language=fi-FI|trans-title=Saturday Essay: How is it possible that Nazi Germany awarded Finnish Jews with an Iron Cross during the Continuation War?}}&lt;/ref&gt; German command mentioned Finnish Jews at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in January 1942, wishing to transport them to the [[Majdanek]] concentration camp in [[General Government|occupied Poland]].

== Soviet offensive phase in 1944 ==

===Air raids and the Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive===
[[File:Continuation War September 1944 English.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|The front lines on 4 September 1944 when the ceasefire came into effect and two weeks before the war concluded]]

Finland began to seek an exit from the war after the German defeat at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in February 1943. Prime Minister [[Edwin Linkomies]] formed a new cabinet in March 1943 with peace as the top priority. Similarly, the Finns were distressed by the Allied Invasion of Sicily in July and the German defeat in the [[Battle of Kursk]] in August. Negotiations were conducted intermittently during 1943–1944 between Finland, the Western Allies and the USSR, but no agreement was reached.{{sfn|Reiter|2009|p=|pp=134–137}} Stalin decided to force Finland to surrender with a [[Bombing of Helsinki in World War II|bombing campaign on Helsinki]], starting in February 1944. It included three major air attacks totaling over 6,000 [[sortie]]s. Finnish [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defence]] repelled the raids and only five per cent of the dropped [[Aerial bomb|bombs]] hit their planned targets. In Helsinki, decoy searchlights and fires were placed outside the city to deceive Soviet bombers into dropping their payloads on unpopulated areas. Major air attacks also hit [[Oulu]] and [[Kotka]], but pre-emptive radio intelligence and effective defence kept the number of casualties low.&lt;ref name="Mäkelä_67"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ch/books/about/Helsinki_liekeiss%C3%A4.html?id=NGsJAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Helsinki liekeissä: suurpommitukset helmikuussa 1944|last1=Mäkelä|first1=Jukka|publisher=W.

The Soviet [[Leningrad–Novgorod Offensive]] finally lifted the Siege of Leningrad on 26–27 January 1944&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and pushed Army Group North to [[Ida-Viru County]] on the Estonian border. Stiff [[Battle of Narva (1944)|German and Estonian defence in Narva]] from February to August prevented the use of occupied Estonia as a favourable base for Soviet amphibious and air assaults against Helsinki and other Finnish coastal cities in support of a land offensive.&lt;ref name="paulman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ot Narvy do Syrve|last=Paulman|first=F.

===Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive and breakthrough===
{{Main|Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive}}

On 9 June 1944, the Soviet Leningrad Front launched an offensive against Finnish positions on the Karelian Isthmus and in the area of Lake Ladoga, timed to coincide with [[Operation Overlord]] in Normandy as agreed during the [[Tehran Conference]].{{sfn|Jutikkala|Pirinen|1988|p=248}} The main objective of the offensive was to force Finland out of the war. Along the {{convert|21.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}-wide breakthrough, the Red Army concentrated 3,000 guns and mortars. In some places, the concentration of artillery pieces exceeded 200 guns for every kilometre of front or one for every {{convert|5|m|yd|abbr=on}}. Soviet artillery fired over 80,000 rounds along the front on the Karelian Isthmus. On the second day of the offensive, the artillery barrages and superior number of Soviet forces crushed the main Finnish defence line. The Red Army penetrated the second line of defence, the [[VT-line|Vammelsuu–Taipale line]] (VT line), by the sixth day and recaptured Viipuri with insignificant resistance on 20 June. The Soviet breakthrough on the Karelian Isthmus forced the Finns to reinforce the area, thus allowing the concurrent Soviet offensive in East Karelia to meet less resistance and to recapture Petrozavodsk by 28 June 1944.{{sfn|Erickson|1993|p=197}}{{sfn|Gebhardt|1990|p=2}}{{sfn|Glantz|House|1998|p=202}}

[[File:Tali-Ihantala.jpg|thumb|left|Finnish soldiers carrying {{Lang|de|Panzerfäuste}} on their shoulders pass by the remains of a destroyed Soviet [[T-34]] tank at the [[Battle of Tali-Ihantala]]]]

On 25 June, the Red Army reached the third line of defence, the [[VKT-line|Viipuri–Kuparsaari–Taipale line]] (VKT line), and the decisive [[Battle of Tali-Ihantala]] began, which has been described as the largest battle in Nordic military history.{{Sfn|Nenye|Munter|Wirtanen|Birks|2016|p=21}} By this point, the Finnish Army had retreated around {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} to approximately the same line of defence they had held at the end of the Winter War. Finland especially lacked modern anti-tank weaponry that could stop Soviet heavy armour, such as the [[Kliment Voroshilov tank|KV-1]] or [[IS tank family|IS-2]]. Thus, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop offered German hand-held ''[[Panzerfaust]]'' and ''[[Panzerschreck]]'' antitank weapons in exchange for a guarantee that Finland would not seek a separate peace with the USSR. On 26 June, President Risto Ryti gave the [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement|guarantee as a personal undertaking]], which he, Field Marshal Mannerheim and Prime Minister Edwin Linkomies intended to legally last only for the remainder of Ryti's presidency. In addition to delivering thousands of anti-tank weapons, Hitler sent the [[122nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|122nd Infantry Division]] and the half-strength 303rd Assault Gun Brigade armed with [[Sturmgeschütz III]] tank destroyers as well as the Luftwaffe's [[Detachment Kuhlmey]] to provide temporary support in the most vulnerable sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Virkkunen|1985|pp=297–300}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the new supplies and assistance from Germany, the Finnish Army halted the numerically and materially superior Soviet advance at Tali-Ihantala on 9 July 1944 and stabilised the front.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bg8drRyDGhEC&amp;pg=PA184|title=500 Days: The War in Eastern Europe, 1944–1945|first=Sean M.|last=Mcateer|year=2009|publisher=Dorrance Publishing|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229173003/https://books.google.com/books?id=Bg8drRyDGhEC&amp;pg=PA184|archivedate=29 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jowett|Snodgrass|2012|p=14}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dh6jydKXikoC&amp;pg=PA467|title=Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: F–O|first=Tony|last=Jaques|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229173003/https://books.google.com/books?id=Dh6jydKXikoC&amp;pg=PA467|archivedate=29 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More battles were fought toward the end of the war, the last of which was the [[Battle of Ilomantsi]], fought between 26 July and 13 August 1944 and resulting in a Finnish victory with the destruction of two Soviet divisions.{{sfn|Moisala|Alanen|1988}}{{sfn|Lunde|2011|p=299}}{{sfn|Raunio|Kilin|2008|pp=287–291}} Resisting the Soviet offensive had exhausted Finnish resources.

===Ceasefire and peace===
{{Main|Moscow Armistice}}
[[File:Officers comparing watches.jpg|thumb|A Soviet (left) and a Finnish officer comparing their watches on 4 September 1944 at Vyborg]]

Finland was required to return to the borders agreed to in the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty, demobilise its armed forces, fulfill war reparations and cede the municipality of Petsamo. The Finns were also required to immediately end any diplomatic relations with Germany and expel the {{lang|de|Wehrmacht}} from Finnish territory by 15 September 1944; any troops remaining were to be disarmed, arrested and turned over to the Allies. The Parliament of Finland accepted the terms in a secret meeting on 2 September and requested that official negotiations for an armistice begin. The Finnish Army implemented a ceasefire at 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. Helsinki time on 4 September; the Red Army followed suit a day later. On 14 September, a delegation led by Finnish Prime Minister [[Antti Hackzell]] and Foreign Minister [[Carl Enckell]] began negotiating, with the USSR and the United Kingdom, the final terms of the Moscow Armistice, which eventually included additional stipulations from the Soviets. They were presented by Molotov on 18 September and accepted by the Finnish Parliament a day later.{{sfn|Vehviläinen|2002|pp=147–149}}{{Sfn|Nenye|Munter|Wirtanen|Birks|2016|pp=529–531}}

&lt;!-- Remember to be neutral per WP:NEUTRAL and add verifiable, reliable sources per WP:VERIFY! --&gt;The motivations for the Soviet peace agreement with Finland are debated. Several Western historians stated that the original Soviet designs for Finland were no different from their designs for the Baltic countries. American political scientist [[Dan Reiter]] asserted that for Moscow, the control of Finland was necessary. Reiter and British historian [[Victor Rothwell]] both quoted Molotov telling his Lithuanian counterpart in 1940, when the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|USSR effectively annexed Lithuania]], that minor states such as Finland, "will be included within the honourable family of Soviet peoples."{{sfn|Reiter|2009|p=131}}&lt;ref name="Rothwell2006"&gt;{{cite book|title=War Aims in the Second World War: The War Aims of the Key Belligerents 1939–1945|last=Rothwell|first=Victor|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0748615032|pages=143, 145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reiter stated that concern over severe losses pushed Stalin into accepting a limited outcome in the war rather than pursuing annexation, although some Soviet documents called for military occupation of Finland. He also wrote that Stalin had described territorial concessions, reparations and military bases as his objective with Finland to representatives from the UK, in December 1941, and the US, in March 1943, as well as the Tehran Conference. He believed that in the end "Stalin's desire to crush Hitler quickly and decisively without distraction from the Finnish sideshow" concluded the war.{{sfn|Reiter|2009|p=|pp=134–136, 138}}

Russian historian Nikolai Baryshnikov disputed the view that the Soviet Union sought to deprive Finland of its independence. He argued that there is no documentary evidence for such claims and that the Soviet government was always open for negotiations. Baryshnikov cited, for example, the then-public-information chief of Finnish Headquarters, Major [[Kalle Lehmus]], to show that Finnish leadership had learned of the limited Soviet plans for Finland by at least July 1944 after intelligence revealed that some Soviet divisions were to be transferred to reserve in Leningrad.{{Sfn|Baryshnikov|2002|pp=222–223 (section heading "Стремительный прорыв", paragraph 48 after cit. 409 et seq.)}} Finnish historian [[Heikki Ylikangas]] stated similar findings in 2009. According to him, the USSR refocused its efforts in the summer of 1944, from the Finnish front to defeating Germany and that Mannerheim received intelligence from Colonel [[Aladár Paasonen]] in June 1944 that the Soviet Union was aiming for peace, not occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yhden miehen jatkosota|last=Ylikangas|first=Heikki|publisher=Otava|year=2009|isbn=978-951-1-24054-9|location=|pages=40–61|language=fi|trans-title=One Man's Continuation War}}&lt;/ref&gt;
