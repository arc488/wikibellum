The '''Battle of the Malacca Strait''', sometimes called the '''Sinking of ''Haguro''''', and in Japanese sources as the '''Battle off Penang''' (ペナン沖海戦), was a naval battle that resulted from the British search-and-destroy operation in May 1945, called Operation Dukedom, that resulted in the sinking of the Japanese cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Haguro||2}}. ''Haguro'' had been operating as a supply ship for Japanese garrisons in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]] since 1 May 1945.

==Background==
On 9 May, ''Haguro'' left [[Singapore]], escorted by the destroyer {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kamikaze|1922|2}}, to evacuate the [[Japanese occupation of the Andaman Islands|Japanese garrison in the Andaman Islands]] located in [[Port Blair]] back to [[Singapore]]. The [[Royal Navy]] was alerted to this by a decrypted [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese naval]] signal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Ashley|authorlink=|title=The British Empire and the Second World War|publisher=Hambledon Continuum|year=2006|location=London|url=|doi=|isbn=1-85285-417-0|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Scott, "Solving Japanese Naval Ciphers 1943 – 45", [[Cryptologia]], Vol 21(2), April 1997, pp149–157&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently confirmed by a sighting by the submarines {{HMS|Statesman|P246|6}} and {{HMS|Subtle|P251|2}}. Force 61 of the [[Eastern Fleet]] set sail on 10 May from [[Trincomalee]], [[Ceylon]], to intercept the Japanese [[flotilla]]. The Japanese were unwilling to risk any battle and, on receipt of an air reconnaissance warning, they returned to Singapore.

On 14 May, ''Haguro'' and ''Kamikaze'' tried again and left Singapore. The next day, they were spotted by aircraft from Force 61. The subsequent bombing attack by [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Grumman Avenger IIs]] of [[851 Naval Air Squadron]] caused only minor damage to ''Haguro'', for the loss of an aircraft whose crew was taken prisoner by the Japanese.

==Battle==
Information was relayed to the Japanese that two British destroyer squadrons had been sighted heading towards them. Again, they reversed course to return to the [[Malacca Strait]]. This change had been anticipated, however, and the 26th Destroyer Flotilla,  under Captain [[Manley Laurence Power|Manley Power]], steamed to intercept. The Flotilla was made up of {{HMS|Saumarez|G12|6}} (Flag), {{HMS|Verulam|R28|2}}, {{HMS|Venus|R50|2}}, {{HMS|Vigilant|R93|2}}, and {{HMS|Virago|R75|2}}.

In heavy rain squalls with lightning, ''Venus'' made radar contact at {{convert|34|nmi|mi km|lk=in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Proceedings"&gt;Calnan, Dennis, CDR RN. "The ''Saumarez'' and the ''Haguro''". ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'', October 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; The British destroyers arranged themselves in a crescent cordon and allowed the Japanese ships to sail into the trap.

At 01:05, ''Venus'', parallel to ''Haguro'' as she raced past the north-westernmost ship in Power's force, found herself in a perfect attacking position. But the Torpedo Control Officer aboard ''Venus'' had made the wrong angle settings on her eight tubes, the opportunity was lost and ''Venus'' heeled hard over to port to clear the target area but still maintain the encirclement. ''Haguro'', thinking ''Venus'' had launched torpedoes, altered course away to [[Golden Comb (tactic)|comb the tracks]]. In so doing, she turned south and deeper into the trap.&lt;ref name="Thomas, David 1976 p. 48"&gt;Thomas, David (1976). Hunting the Haguro, p. 48. Marshall Cavendish Ltd. ISSN 0307-2886.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Saumarez'' and ''Verulam'' were now well positioned to make their attacks. ''Haguro'' appeared fine off ''Saumarez''{{'}}s port bow at a range of 6,000 yards (3.4 miles), each ship closing at 30 knots. At the same time, the Japanese destroyer ''Kamikaze'' appeared off the starboard bow, crossing from starboard to port, only 3,000 yards away and on a collision course. ''Saumarez's'' second salvo from her two forward, radar-controlled 4.7in guns struck ''Kamikaze'' and 40mm [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors]] shells from the British ship's aft twin-mounting ripped the 320ft length of the Japanese destroyer as ''Saumarez'' heeled to starboard. ''Haguro'' now fired her first broadside of ten 8in and four 5in guns at ''Saumarez''.&lt;ref name="Thomas, David 1976 p. 48"/&gt; Tremendous waterspouts thrown up alongside swamped the British flotilla leader's upper decks as ''Haguro'' was seen clearly three miles away in the light of both sides' star-shells.

At 01:11, just as she was about to fire torpedoes, ''Saumarez'' was hit. The top of her funnel disappeared over the side and a 5in shell penetrated No. 1 Boiler Room, severed a steam main and lodged inside the boiler. Five men were scalded, two of whom died, but as with the 8in shell hits, this shell failed to explode at such close range and was later thrown overboard.&lt;ref name="Thomas, David 1976 p. 48"/&gt;

At 01:15, ''Haguro'' was hit by three torpedoes from ''Saumarez'' and ''Verulam''. As ''Saumarez'' limped northward from the immediate battle area, a violent explosion created confusion. Power thought it was ''Kamikaze'' blowing up and men on ''Virago'' and ''Vigilant'' thought it was ''Saumarez'', but it was probably two torpedoes colliding.&lt;ref name="Thomas, David 1976 p. 48"/&gt; ''Venus'' hit ''Haguro'' with one torpedo at 01:25, and ''Virago'' stopped ''Haguro'' with two more torpedo hits two minutes later. The Japanese cruiser finally sank at 02:06 after receiving another torpedo from ''Vigilant'', two more from ''Venus'', and nearly an hour of gunfire from the 26th Flotilla.&lt;ref name="Proceedings"/&gt;

''Saumarez''{{'}}s main [[aerial (radio)|aerial]] and a funnel top had been shot away, and an {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on}} shell nicked the [[forecastle]]. Two men were killed and three burned in the boiler room when a {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} shell severed the main steam pipe. There was no damage to the remainder of the 26th Flotilla.&lt;ref name="Proceedings"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
''Kamikaze'' was also damaged, but escaped, returning the next day to rescue survivors. About 320 survived, but over 900 died, including the Japanese commanders, Vice-Admiral Hashimoto and Rear-Admiral Sugiura.

This was one of the last major surface gun and torpedo actions of World War II. Lord [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]], himself a distinguished destroyer captain, described it in his Report to the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] (CCS) as 'an outstanding example of a night attack by destroyers.'&lt;ref name="Thomas, David 1976 p. 48"/&gt;

==Shipwreck==
The wreck was discovered sitting upright in 2003 and partially explored by a group of specialised shipwreck divers aboard MV ''Empress''. In 2010 another diving expedition, also aboard MV ''Empress'', surveyed the wreck in detail.&lt;ref&gt;https://explorers.org/pdf/TEC_2010_Flag._REVISED_Report._Kevin_V._Denlay_Operation_Dukedome_Flag_52_Nov._2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, the wreck was ravaged by illegal salvagers for scrap metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chua |first1=Eddie |title=Sea salvage work halted |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2014/05/23/sea-salvage-work-halted-dept-sinks-its-teeth-into-vessel-illegally-stripping-wrecks-for-scrap/ |accessdate=10 June 2019 |agency=The Star Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;
