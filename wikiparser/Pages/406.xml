The '''Gumbinnen Operation''',&lt;ref name=glantz&gt;Glantz, ''Failures of Historiography''&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''Goldap Operation''' (or '''Goldap-Gumbinnen Operation''', {{lang-ru|Гумбиннен-Гольдапская наступательная операция}}), was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] offensive on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] late in 1944, in which forces of the [[3rd Belorussian Front]] attempted to penetrate the borders of [[East Prussia]].

The offensive failed, due to strong resistance by the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''. As a result, it is largely known through German accounts of the defense and because of the atrocities that were committed by troops of the [[11th Guards Army]], most notably the [[Nemmersdorf massacre]].

==Planning==

The operation was planned as a result of the success of the [[Battle of Memel|Memel Offensive Operation]] to the north. The troops of the 1st Baltic and 3rd Belorussian Fronts had succeeded in pushing the [[3rd Panzer Army|Third Panzer Army]] back to the East Prussian border, surrounding the city of [[Klaipėda|Memel]] and reaching the shore of the [[Curonian Lagoon]]. ''[[Stavka]]'' permitted Chernyakhovsky to further exploit this success by attacking along the [[Gusev, Kaliningrad Oblast|Gumbinnen]] – [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]] – [[Königsberg]] (now [[Kaliningrad]]) axis deep into [[East Prussia]].

Chernyakhovsky's plan involved using the [[11th Guards Army|11th Guards]] and [[5th Army (Soviet Union)|5th]] Armies to break open the German defensive lines, before pushing through exploitation forces from the [[2nd Guards Tank Corps]] and [[28th Army (Soviet Union)|28th Army]]. The [[31st Army (Soviet Union)|31st]] and [[39th Army (Soviet Union)|39th]] Armies would advance on the flanks of the main force.

The opposing German forces, from the [[3rd Panzer Army|Third Panzer]] and [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourth]] Armies, were aided by the presence of substantial fortifications, and had been heavily reinforced.

==The offensive==

On 16 October, the 5th and 11th Guards Armies went onto the offensive and initially penetrated some 11&amp;nbsp;km into the German defensive belt. The flanking armies commenced operations the next day, by which time units of the 11th Guards Army had crossed the East Prussian border.

The Soviet troops ran into extremely strong resistance. It took them four days to penetrate the initial tactical defenses, while the second defense line was so strong that Chernyakhovsky was compelled to commit the 2nd Guards Tank Corps to break it. Casualties were extremely heavy. On 20 October, the second line was ruptured by the 11th Guards Army and 2nd Guards Tank Corps east of Gumbinnen, defended by the guns of the [[18th Anti-Aircraft Division (Germany)|18th Anti-Aircraft Division]] and the [[1st Fallschirm-Panzer Division Hermann Göring|Fallschirm-Panzerdivision Hermann Göring]], which had been redeployed in the area to counter the Soviet advance. On 21 October, the Soviets' reserve, the 28th Army, was committed, but the offensive in the north was fought to a standstill in the region of [[Nesterov|Ebenrode]] thanks to some effective German counter-attacks.

Gumbinnen was taken by 22 October, but retaken by German forces on the 24 October, after the Germans committed the [[5th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|5th Panzer Division]], and [[German heavy tank battalions|Heavy Panzer Detachment 505]] (equipped with [[Tiger II]]s). Also [[Mayakovskoye|Nemmersdorf]] (located on the banks of the [[Angrapa River]]) was taken by units of the 2nd Guards Tank Corps on the 21 October, but already retaken by German forces on the 23 October.  

Units of 11th Guards Army found themselves cut off in the area of Großwaltersdorf, and were involved in intense fighting. In the meantime, the Germans had pressed more reserves, including the [[102nd Panzer Brigade|102nd Panzer]] and [[Führer Grenadier Brigade|Führer Grenadier]] Brigades into counter-attacks at [[Gołdap|Goldap]], on the southern sector of the Soviet penetration. The town was retaken on 25 October.

The Soviet attacks continued until 27 October, as the flanking armies sought to close up to the 11th Guards Army.

There was more fighting in the operation's immediate aftermath: on 28 October, the 31st Army retook Gołdap in a surprise attack; the town was again taken by the 5th Panzer Division, which was redeployed from the Gumbinnen area, on 3 November.
