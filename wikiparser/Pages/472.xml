The '''Battle of the Komandorski Islands''' was a [[naval battle]] between [[United States|American]] and [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] forces which took place on 27 March 1943 in the North Pacific, south of the Soviet [[Komandorski Islands]].  The battle was a daylight surface engagement in which air support played no role and in which the inferior American force mostly escaped complete destruction by luck.

==Background==
When the United States became aware of Japanese plans to send a supply [[convoy]] to their forces on the [[Aleutian Islands]] of Alaska, [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] ships commanded by [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Charles McMorris]] were sent to prevent this. The fleet consisted of the [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Salt Lake City|CA-25|2}}, the  [[light cruiser]] {{USS|Richmond|CL-9|2}} and the [[destroyer]]s {{USS|Coghlan|DD-606|2}}, {{USS|Bailey|DD-492|2}}, {{USS|Dale|DD-353|2}} and {{USS|Monaghan|DD-354|2}}.&lt;ref name=Dull&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dull|first1=Paul S.|title=A battle history of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1941-1945|date=2007|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis|isbn=1-59114-219-9|pages=261–265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SLfti-Dc1AcC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=Battle+of+the+Komandorski+Islands&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vD0LVbH9HMS-ggSgx4HwDQ&amp;ved=0CDwQuwUwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Komandorski%20Islands&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American intelligence estimated that the Japanese escort consisted of one heavy cruiser, one light cruiser, and four destroyers.&lt;ref name="O'Hara"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Hara|first1=Vincent P.|title=The U.S. Navy against the Axis : surface combat, 1941-1945|date=2007|publisher=Naval Inst.

On the early morning of 26 March, the Japanese convoy was intercepted by the American picket line some 100 miles south of the Komandorski islands and 180 miles west of [[Attu Island|Attu]], just to the west of the [[International Date Line]].&lt;ref name="O'Hara" /&gt; Because of the remote location of the battle and chance encounter on open ocean, neither fleet had air or submarine assistance, making this one of the few engagements exclusively between [[surface ship]]s in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]] and one of the last pure gunnery duels between fleets of major surface combatants in [[naval history]].

Although the Japanese cruisers heavily outgunned the American force, the engagement was tactically inconclusive. Both fleets suffered damage, with the U.S. Navy warships escaping almost by luck. With the Japanese fleet on the edge of victory, Admiral Hosogaya — not realizing the heavy damage his ships had inflicted and fearing American war planes would appear — retired without destroying his enemy. This amounted to a strategic defeat, as it ended Japanese attempts to resupply the Aleutian garrisons by surface ship, leaving only submarines to conduct supply runs. Hosogaya was accordingly retired from active service after the battle and assigned to [[Governor of the South Seas Mandate|govern a group of South Pacific islands]].

==Battle==
*0600: The United States ships were formed in a scouting line at six-mile intervals zig-zagging at 15 knots on base course 020°.
*0730: Lead ships ''Coghlan'' and ''Richmond'' made [[radar]] contact with the two trailing Japanese transports and a destroyer on course 080° at {{convert|13|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. A navigating officer on one of the transports visually observed the American force minutes later.
*0740: The Americans changed course to 080° and the rear ships increased speed to operate as a compact group. Five radar contacts were counted.
*0755: The Japanese turned northward to course 340° and the Americans came to course 000° to follow.
*0811: The Americans visually identified the radar contacts as two transports, two light cruisers, and a destroyer.
*0820: The Americans sighted the masts of four more Japanese ships on the horizon.
*0835: The Americans identified the masts as two heavy cruisers and two destroyers and turned to course 240°.
*0838: The Japanese transports swerved off to the northwest.
*0839: The Americans increased speed to {{convert|25|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}.
*0840: ''Nachi'' opened fire on ''Richmond'' at a range of {{convert|20000|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The second and third salvos were straddles.
*0841: ''Richmond'' opened fire on ''Nachi''. The third salvo was a straddle.
*0842: ''Salt Lake City'' opened fire on ''Nachi'' at a range of {{convert|21000|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The second salvo was a straddle.

As the range closed, ''Bailey'' opened fire on ''Nachi'' at a range of {{convert|14000|yd|m|abbr=on}} and then switched to a light cruiser. ''Coghlan'' opened fire on ''Nachi'' at a range of {{convert|18000|yd|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="proceedings"&gt;Millsap, Ralph H., CDR USN "Skill or Luck?" ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings Supplement'' March 1985 pp.78-87&lt;/ref&gt;

*0845: ''Nachi'' launched eight torpedoes. All missed.
*0850: One of ''Richmond''′s {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}} shells hit the starboard side of ''Nachi''′s signal bridge, killing 11 and wounding 21. Another shell hit ''Nachi''′s mainmast and severed the flagship radio communication.
*0852: One of ''Richmond''′s 6-inch shells hit ''Nachi''′s torpedo compartment. Another of ''Richmond''′s 6-inch shells hit ''Nachi''′s control room, killing two and wounding five. ''Nachi'' dropped back after losing electrical power to ammunition hoists and gun mounts.
*0903: ''Richmond'' ceased firing. ''Salt Lake City'' continued firing from stern turrets.
*0910: ''Salt Lake City'' was hit by an {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on}} projectile fired by ''Maya''. The starboard observation plane caught fire and was jettisoned.
*0920: ''Salt Lake City'' was hit by an 8-inch projectile fired by ''Maya''. Two men were killed.
*1010: ''Salt Lake City'' was hit by an 8-inch projectile fired by ''Maya''.
*1059: ''Salt Lake City'' was hit by an 8-inch projectile fired by ''Maya''.
*1103: ''Salt Lake City'' was hit by an 8-inch projectile fired by ''Maya''. ''Salt Lake City'' transferred water to correct a list caused by flooding.
*1152: ''Salt Lake City'' was hit by an 8-inch projectile fired by ''Maya''.
*1153: Salt water entered a fuel tank in use and extinguished ''Salt Lake City''′s boiler fires.
*1154: ''Salt Lake City'' slowed to a stop. ''Bailey'', ''Coghlan'' and ''Monaghan'' approached the Japanese cruisers for a torpedo attack while ''Richmond'' and ''Dale'' made smoke to shield ''Salt Lake City''.
*1203: ''Salt Lake City'' restarted boilers and increased speed to 15&amp;nbsp;knots.
*1213: ''Salt Lake City'' increased speed to {{convert|22|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}.
*1225: ''Bailey'' launched five torpedoes at {{convert|9500|yd|m|abbr=on}}. All missed. ''Bailey'' was hit twice by 8-inch shells and came to a stop with five dead. ''Coghlan'' was hit once.
*1230: Japanese ships retired westward. Neither ''Coghlan'' nor ''Monaghan'' launched torpedoes.

''Salt Lake City'' fired 806 armor-piercing projectiles and then 26 high-capacity (explosive) shells after the supply of armor-piercing ammunition was exhausted. Powder and shells were manhandled aft from the forward magazines to keep the after guns firing. ''Salt Lake City''′s rudder stops were carried away, limiting her to 10° course changes.&lt;ref name="proceedings"/&gt;
