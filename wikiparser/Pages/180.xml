'''Operation Goodwood''' was a British offensive in the [[Second World War]], that took place between 18 and 20 July 1944 as part of the [[battle for Caen]] in [[Normandy]], France. The objective of the operation was a limited attack to the south, to capture the rest of Caen and the Bourguébus Ridge beyond.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=64}} At least one historian has called the operation the largest tank battle that the [[British Army]] has ever fought.

Goodwood was preceded by preliminary attacks later called the [[Second Battle of the Odon]]. The offensive began when the British [[VIII Corps (United Kingdom)|VIII Corps]], with three armoured divisions, attacked to seize the German-held Bourguébus Ridge, the area between [[Bretteville-sur-Laize]] and [[Vimont, Calvados|Vimont]] and to inflict maximum casualties on the Germans. On 18 July, the British [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] conducted an advance to secure a series of villages and the eastern flank of VIII Corps and to the west, the [[II Canadian Corps]] launched [[Operation Atlantic]], synchronised with Goodwood, to capture the rest of [[Caen]] south of the Orne River. When Operation Goodwood ended on 20 July, the armoured divisions had broken through the outer German defences and advanced {{convert|7|mi|km|abbr=on}} but had been stopped short of Bourguébus Ridge, only armoured cars having penetrated further south and beyond the ridge. 

While Goodwood failed in its primary aim, it forced the Germans to keep powerful formations opposite the British and Canadians on the eastern flank of the Normandy [[beachhead]] and [[Operation Cobra]], the First US Army attack which began on 25 July, caused the weaker German defences opposite to collapse.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=64}} 

==Background==

===Caen===
{{Further|Invasion of Normandy|Operation Overlord}}

The historic Normandy town of Caen was a [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] objective for the British [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Infantry Division]], which landed on [[Sword Beach]] on 6 June 1944.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=24}} The capture of Caen, while "ambitious", was called the most important D-Day objective assigned to [[I Corps (United Kingdom)|I Corps]] ([[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[John Crocker]]).{{efn|"The quick capture of that key city Caen and the neighbourhood of Carpiquet was the most ambitious, the most difficult and the most important task of Lieutenant-General J. T. Crocker's I Corps".{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=171}} Wilmot wrote that "The objectives given to Crocker's seaborne divisions were decidedly ambitious, since his troops were to land last, on the most exposed beaches, with the farthest to go, against what was potentially the greatest opposition".{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=273}} The [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] (Lieutenant-General [[Miles Dempsey]]), always considered the possibility that the attack on Caen might fail.{{sfn|Buckley|2014|p=23}}}} [[Operation Overlord]] called for Second Army to secure the city and then form a front line from [[Caumont-l'Éventé]]–south-east of [[Caen]], to acquire space for airfields and to protect the left flank of the [[First United States Army|First US Army]] ([[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Omar Bradley|Omar N. Bradley]]), while it moved on [[Cherbourg]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=78}} Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give the Second Army a staging area for a push south to capture [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]], which could be used as the pivot for a swing left, to advance on [[Argentan]] and then towards the [[Touques River]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=81}} The terrain between Caen and [[Vimont, Calvados|Vimont]] was especially promising, being open, dry and conducive to mobile operations. Since the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] greatly outnumbered the Germans in tanks and mobile units, a fluid fast-moving battle was to their advantage.{{sfn|Vat|2003|p=146}}

Hampered by congestion in the beachhead and forced to divert effort to attack strongly held German positions along the {{convert|9.3|mi|km|abbr=on}} route to the town, the 3rd Infantry Division was unable to assault Caen in force and was stopped short of the outskirts.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|pp=284–286}} Follow-up attacks were unsuccessful as German resistance solidified; abandoning the direct approach, [[Operation Perch]]—a [[pincer attack]] by I Corps and [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]]—was launched on 7 June, to encircle Caen from the east and west. I Corps, striking south out of the [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)#D-Day|Orne bridgehead]], was halted by the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] and the attack by XXX Corps bogged down in front of [[Tilly-sur-Seulles]], west of Caen, against the [[Panzer Lehr Division]].{{sfn|Forty|2004|p=36}}{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=247, 250}} The [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] pushed through a gap in the German front line and tried to capture the town of [[Villers-Bocage, Calvados|Villers-Bocage]] in the German rear.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=254}}{{sfn|Taylor|1999|p=10}} The [[Battle of Villers-Bocage]] saw the vanguard of the 7th Armoured Division withdraw from the town but by 17 June, Panzer Lehr had been forced back and XXX Corps had taken Tilly-sur-Seulles.{{sfn|Taylor|1999|p=76}}{{sfn|Forty|2004|p=97}} The British postponed plans for further offensive operations, including a second attack by the 7th Armoured Division, when a severe storm descended upon the [[English Channel]] on 19 June.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=255}} The storm lasted for three days, significantly delayed the Allied build-up.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=114}} Most of the landing craft and ships already at sea were driven back to ports in Britain; towed barges and other loads (including {{convert|2.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} of floating roadways for the [[Mulberry harbour]]s) were lost and {{nowrap|800 craft}} were stranded on the Normandy beaches, until the next high tides in July.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=322}}

===Epsom, Windsor and Charnwood===
{{main|Operation Epsom|Operation Windsor|Operation Charnwood}}

After a few days to recover from the storm, the British began [[Operation Epsom]] on 26 June. The newly arrived [[VIII Corps (United Kingdom)|VIII Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Richard O'Connor]]), was to attack west of Caen, southwards across the [[River Odon|Odon]] and Orne rivers, capture an area of high ground near [[Bretteville-sur-Laize]], encircling the city.{{sfn|Clark|2004|pp=31–32}} The attack was preceded by [[Operation Martlet]], to secure the VIII Corps flank by capturing high ground on the right of the axis of advance.{{sfn|Clark|2004|p=21}} The Germans managed to contain the offensive by committing all their strength, including two panzer divisions just arrived in Normandy, earmarked for an offensive against British and American positions around Bayeux.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=108}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2002|p=13}}{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=334}} Several days later, the Second Army made a frontal assault on Caen [[Operation Charnwood]].{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=131}} The attack was preceded by [[Operation Windsor]], to capture the airfield at [[Carpiquet]] just outside Caen.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=60}} By 9 July, Caen north of the Orne and Odon rivers had been captured but German forces retained possession of the south bank and a number of important locations, including the [[Colombelles]] steel works, whose tall chimneys commanded the area.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=131}}{{sfn|Bercuson|2004|p=222}}{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=53}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-721-0353-27A, Collombelles, Soldaten auf Feld vor Fabrik.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A German patrol moves towards the [[Colombelles]] factory area. Some of the tall chimneys used by German observers are visible in the distance.}}]]
Shortly after the capture of northern Caen during Operation Charnwood, the British mounted a raid against the Colombelles steelworks complex to the north-east of the city, which was a failure. The factory area remained in German hands, its tall chimneys providing observation posts that overlooked the Orne bridgehead. At 01:00 on 11 July, elements of the [[153rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|153rd (Highland) Infantry Brigade]], supported by [[M4 Sherman|Sherman]] tanks of the 148th Regiment [[Royal Armoured Corps]] (RAC), moved against the German position.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=49}} The intention was to secure the area for troops from the [[Royal Engineers]] to destroy the chimneys before retiring.{{sfn|Daglish|2005|p=35}} At 05:00, the British force was ambushed by [[Tiger I|Tiger]] tanks and was forced to withdraw after losing nine tanks.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=49}} The Second Army launched two preliminary operations; according to Montgomery, their purpose was to "engage the enemy in battle unceasingly; we must 'write off' his troops; and generally we must kill Germans". Historian Terry Copp called this the moment where the Normandy campaign became a [[Attrition warfare|battle of attrition]].{{sfn|Copp|2004|p=135}}

===Montgomery===
On 10 July, General [[Bernard Montgomery]], the commander of all the Allied ground forces in Normandy, held a meeting at his headquarters with Dempsey and Bradley. They discussed [[21st Army Group]] operations, following the conclusion of Operation Charnwood and the failure of the First US Army break-out offensive.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=49}}{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=351}} Montgomery approved [[Operation Cobra]], an attack to be launched by the First US Army on 18 July.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=175}} Montgomery ordered Dempsey to "go on hitting: drawing the German strength, especially the armour, onto yourself—so as to ease the way for Brad".{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=49}}

In early July, Montgomery had been informed by the [[Adjutant-General to the Forces]], [[Sir Ronald Forbes Adam, 2nd Baronet|Ronald Adam]] that due to the manpower shortage in Britain, the pool of replacements to maintain his infantry strength was nearly exhausted.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=64}} Dempsey proposed an attack consisting solely of armoured divisions, a concept that contradicted Montgomery's policy of never employing an unbalanced force.{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=64–65}}{{efn|In ''Fields of Fire'', Terry Copp suggested that it was Brigadier Charles Richardson, chief planning officer of 21st Army Group, who provided the starting point and inspiration for Operation Goodwood.{{sfn|Copp|2004|p=134}}}} By mid-July, the Second Army had {{nowrap|2,250 [[medium tank]]s}} and {{nowrap|400 [[light tank]]s}} in the bridgehead, of which {{nowrap|500 were}} in reserve to replace losses.{{sfn|Hart|2007|p=65}}{{sfn| Vat|2003| p=158}}{{sfn|Dunphie|2005|p=30}} The armoured element of the Second Army consisted of the [[Guards Armoured Division]], [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] and the [[British 11th Armoured Division|11th Armoured Division]] and the [[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East|4th Armoured Brigade]], [[8th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Armoured Brigade]], [[27th Armoured Brigade]] and 33rd Armoured brigades, the 31st and 34th Tank brigades and the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade.{{sfn|Fortin|2004|pp=44, 52, 58, 64, 69, 74}}{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=55}}{{sfn|Buckley|2014|p=19}}{{efn|Excluding the 79th Armoured Division, which never operated as a formation and the 6th Guards Tank Brigade still in England.{{sfn|Fortin|2004|p=47}} The tank brigades were equipped with Churchill infantry tanks and a small number of light tanks.{{sfn|Clark|2004|p=36}}{{sfn|Fortin|2004|pp=47, 64, 74, 100}}}}

At 10:00 on 13 July, Dempsey met with Crocker, Lieutenant-General Simonds of II Canadian Corps and O'Connor.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=70}} Later that day, the first written order for Operation Goodwood—named after the [[Glorious Goodwood]] race meeting—was issued.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=64}}{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=330}} The document contained only preliminary instructions and general intentions; it was to stimulate detailed planning and alterations were expected.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=72}} The order was also sent to senior planners in the United Kingdom so that air support for the operation could be secured.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=353}} When VIII Corps had assembled in Normandy in mid-June, it was suggested that the corps be used to attack out of the Orne bridgehead, to outflank Caen from the east but Operation Dreadnought was cancelled when Dempsey and O'Connor doubted the feasibility of the operation.{{efn|There is some disagreement whether Montgomery or Dempsey cancelled the operation. Montgomery wrote that he cancelled the operation over O'Connor's doubts about the plan and decided to attack west of Caen, in what became Operation Epsom; while Dempsey, after the war, told [[Chester Wilmot]] that he informed Montgomery that he was going to cancel the proposed operation on 18 June.{{sfn|Hart|2007|pp=131–132}}}}

===Goodwood plan===

{{Further|Operation Goodwood order of battle}}

[[File:AtlanticGoodwood Battle plan.jpg|thumb|{{centre|The planned attack for operations Atlantic and Goodwood. It shows where the Second Army knew the locations of several German divisions as well as where they believed others were.}}]]
In the outline for Goodwood, VIII Corps, with three armoured divisions, would attack southwards out of the Orne bridgehead.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=72}} The 11th Armoured Division was to advance south-west over Bourguébus Ridge and the Caen–Falaise road, aiming for Bretteville-sur-Laize. The [[Guards Armoured Division]] was to push south-east to capture Vimont and Argences and the 7th Armoured Division, starting last, was to aim south for Falaise. The 3rd Infantry Division, supported by part of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, was to secure the eastern flank by capturing the area around [[Émiéville]], [[Touffreville, Eure|Touffréville]] and [[Troarn]].{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=64–65}} The II Canadian Corps would simultaneously launch Operation Atlantic a supporting attack on the VIII Corps western flank, to capture Caen south of the Orne river.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=169}} The British and Canadian operations were tentatively scheduled for 18 July and Cobra was postponed for two days, to enable the First Army to secure its start line around [[Saint-Lô]].{{sfn|Hastings|1999|p=293}}{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=161}}

Detailed planning began on Friday 14 July but the next day, Montgomery issued a written directive ordering Dempsey to change the plan from a "deep break-out" to a "limited attack".{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=79}}{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=66}} Anticipating that the Germans would be forced to commit their armoured reserves, rather than risk a massed British tank breakthrough, VIII Corps was instructed to "engage the German armour in battle and 'write it down' to such an extent that it is of no further value to the Germans".{{sfn|Reynolds|2002|p=44}} He was to take any opportunity to improve the Second Army's position—the orders stated that "a victory on the eastern flank will help us to gain what we want on the western flank"—but not to endanger its role as a "firm bastion" on which the success of the forthcoming American offensive would depend.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=330–331}} The objectives of the three armoured divisions were amended to "dominate the area Bourguébus–Vimont–Bretteville", although it was intended that "armoured cars should push far to the south towards Falaise, spread[ing] alarm and despondency". The objectives for the II Canadian Corps remained unchanged and it was stressed that these were vital, only following their achievement would VIII Corps "'crack about' as the situation demands".{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=331}}

The 11th Armoured Division was to lead the advance, screen [[Cagny, Calvados|Cagny]] and capture [[Bras, Calvados|Bras]], [[Hubert-Folie]], Verrières and [[Fontenay-le-Marmion]].{{sfn|Buckley|2014|p=35}}{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=70}} Its armoured brigade was to bypass most of the German-held villages in its area, leaving them to be dealt with by follow-up waves.{{sfn|Dunphie|2005|p=42}} The [[159th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|159th Infantry Brigade]], was initially to act independently of the rest of the division and capture [[Cuverville, Calvados|Cuverville]] and [[Démouville]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=352}} The Guards Armoured Division, advancing behind the 11th Armoured Division, was to capture Cagny and Vimont.{{sfn|Buckley|2014|p=35}}{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=70}} Starting last, the 7th Armoured Division was to move south beyond the [[Garcelles-Secqueville]] ridge. Further advances by the armoured divisions were to be conducted only on Dempsey's order.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=66}} The detailed orders for the II Canadian Corps were issued a day later, to capture Colombelles, the remaining portion of Caen and then be ready to move on the strongly held [[Verrières, Orne|Verrières]] (Bourguébus) Ridge.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|pp=170–171}} If the German front collapsed, a deeper advance would be considered.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=66}}

Second Army intelligence had formed a good estimate of the opposition Goodwood was likely to face, although the German positions beyond the first line of villages had to be inferred, mainly from inconclusive air reconnaissance.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=53}} The German defensive line was believed to consist of two belts up to {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} deep.{{sfn|Dunphie|2005|p=43}} Aware that the Germans were expecting a large attack out of the Orne bridgehead, the British anticipated meeting resistance from the 16th ''Luftwaffe'' Field Division bolstered by SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 25 of the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]]. [[Signals intelligence]] ascertained that the 12th SS Panzer Division had been moved into reserve and although it was slow to discover that SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 25 was not with the 16th ''Luftwaffe'' Field Division, having also been placed into reserve, this oversight was rectified before 18 July. Battle groups of the 21st Panzer Division with around {{nowrap|50 [[Panzer IV]]}} and {{nowrap|34 [[assault guns]],}} were expected near [[Route nationale 13]]. The [[1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]] was identified in reserve with an estimated {{nowrap|40 [[Panther tank]]s}} and {{nowrap|60 Panzer IV}} and the presence of two heavy tank battalions equipped with Tiger tanks was established.{{efn|1st SS Panzer Division actually had {{nowrap|46 Panthers}} and {{nowrap|61 Panzer IV.}} Both battalions were erroneously placed with I SS Panzer Corps but one had been attached to the 21st Panzer Division.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=58, 53–56}}}} German armoured strength was estimated at {{nowrap|230 tanks}} and artillery strength at {{nowrap|300 field}} and anti-tank guns.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=336}}{{efn|Rommel stated that German defences east of the Orne included {{nowrap|194 field}} guns and {{nowrap|90 anti-tank}} guns.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=58, 53–56}}}} The Second Army believed that {{nowrap|90 guns}} were in the centre of the battle zone, {{nowrap|40 on}} the flanks and {{nowrap|20 defending}} the Caen–Vimont railway line. The British had also located a German gun line on the Bourguébus Ridge but its strength and gun positions were unknown.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=58, 53–56}}

[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B7078.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Camouflaged [[Churchill tank]]s of the 31st Tank Brigade, which did not take part in Goodwood, highlighting the efforts taken in Normandy to hide vehicles from enemy observers.}}]]
To mask the operational objectives, the Second Army initiated a deception plan that included diversionary attacks launched by [[XII Corps (United Kingdom)|XII]] and XXX Corps. The three armoured divisions moved to their staging positions west of the Orne only at night and in radio silence; artillery fire was used to mask the noise of the tank engines.{{sfn|Daglish|2005|pp=37, 38}}{{sfn| D'Este| 2004|p=360}} During the hours of daylight all efforts were made to camouflage the new positions.{{sfn|Daglish|2005|p=37}}

For artillery support, Goodwood was allocated {{nowrap|760 guns,}}with {{nowrap|297,600 rounds}} of ammunition. {{nowrap|456 field}} pieces from {{nowrap|19 field}} regiments, {{nowrap|208 medium}} guns from {{nowrap|13 medium}} regiments, {{nowrap|48 heavy}} pieces from {{nowrap|3 heavy}} regiments and {{nowrap|48 heavy}} anti-aircraft guns from two heavy anti-aircraft regiments.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=86}} The artillery was provided by I, VIII, XII Corps and II Canadian Corps as well as the 2nd Canadian [[Army Group Royal Artillery]] (AGRA) and the 4th AGRA.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=68–69}} Each field gun was allocated {{nowrap|500 rounds,}} each medium piece {{nowrap|300 rounds}} and each heavy gun or howitzer {{nowrap|150 rounds.}}{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=86}} Prior to the assault these were to attempt to suppress German anti-tank and field artillery positions. During the attack they would provide the 11th Armoured Division with a [[rolling barrage]] and anti-aircraft defence.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=339}}  The guns would also assist the attacks launched by the 3rd Infantry and 2nd Canadian Infantry divisions and fire on targets as requested.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|pp=85–86}} Additional support would be provided by three ships of the [[Royal Navy]], whose targets were German gun batteries located near the coast in the region of [[Cabourg]] and Franceville.{{ sfn|Jackson|2006|pp=85–86}}{{efn|The monitor {{HMS|Roberts|F40|6}} armed with two 15-inch guns and the light cruisers {{HMS|Mauritius|80|6}} and {{HMS|Enterprise|D52|6}} armed with twelve and seven 6-inch guns respectively. {{sfn|Jackson|2006|pp=85–86}}}}

[[File:York bridge.jpg|thumb|{{centre|[[Cromwell tank]]s moving across York Bridge, a [[Bailey bridge]] built over the [[Caen Canal]] and the [[Orne River]].}}]]
The engineering resources of the Second Army, I and VIII corps and the divisional engineers worked from {{nowrap|13–16 July}} to build six roads from west of the Orne River to the start lines east of the river and the Caen Canal.{{sfn|Daglish|2005|pp=26–29}} Engineers from I Corps strengthened bridges and built two new sets of bridges across the Orne and the canal.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=87}} The engineers were also to construct another two sets of bridges by the end of the first day.{{sfn|Daglish|2005|p=29}}{{efn|These were the first of {{nowrap|1,500 [[bailey bridges]]}} to be built by the British army during the campaign in north-west Europe.{{sfn|Daglish|2005|p=26}}}} II Canadian Corps planned to construct up to three bridges across the Orne as quickly as possible to give I and VIII corps exclusive access to the river and the canal bridges north of Caen.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=87}} Engineers from the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, with a small detachment from the 3rd Infantry Division, were ordered to breach the German minefield in front of the Highland Division. This was largely accomplished during the night of {{nowrap|16/17 July,}} when they cleared and marked fourteen gaps.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=88}} By the morning of 18 July, {{nowrap|19 {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}}-wide}} gaps had been completed, each for one armoured regiment to pass through at a time.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=68}}{{efn|Following Operation Goodwood it took Royal Engineers five days, during daylight hours, to lift all the mines placed in front of the positions previously held by 51st (Highland) Infantry Division. {{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=88}}}}

The 11th Armoured Division infantry brigade, with the divisional and 29th Armoured Brigade headquarters, crossed into the Orne bridgehead during the night of {{nowrap|16/17 July}} and the rest of the division followed the next night.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=91}} The Guards and 7th Armoured divisions were held west of the river until the operation began.{{sfn|D'Este|2004|p=360}} As the final elements of the 11th Armoured Division moved into position and the VIII Corps headquarters took up residence in [[Bény-sur-Mer]], more gaps in the minefields were blown, the forward areas were signposted and routes to be taken marked with white tape.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|pp=91–92}}

====Allied air forces====

The Germans considered the Caen area to be the foundation of their position in Normandy and were determined to maintain a defensive arc from the English Channel to the west bank of the Orne.{{sfn|Daglish|2005|p=36}} On 15 July, German [[military intelligence]] warned Panzer Group West that from 17 July, a British attack out of the Orne bridgehead was likely. It was thought that the British would push south-east towards Paris.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=58}} General [[Heinrich Eberbach]], the commanding officer of Panzer Group West, designed a defensive plan, with its details worked out by his two corps and six divisional commanders.{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=172}} A belt of at least {{convert|10|mi|km}} depth was constructed, organised into four defence lines.  Villages within the belt were fortified and anti-tank guns placed along its southern and eastern edges.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=336}}{{sfn|Jackson|2006|pp=76–77}} To allow tanks to move freely within the belt, the Germans decided not to establish anti-tank minefields between each defensive line.{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=171}} On 16 July, several reconnaissance flights were mounted over the British front but most of these were driven off by anti-aircraft fire.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=92}} As dark fell, camera-equipped aircraft managed to bring back photographs taken by the light of [[flares]], which revealed a one-way flow of traffic over the Orne into the British bridgehead.{{sfn|Daglish|2005|p=37}} Later that day, a British [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] was shot down over German lines while photographing defences; British artillery and fighters attempted to destroy the crashed aircraft without success.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=92}}

One battery of four {{nowrap|88 mm}} anti-aircraft guns from the 2nd ''Flak-Sturm Regiment'', was positioned in Cagny, while in the villages along the Bourguébus Ridge there was a screen of {{nowrap|44 x 88 mm}} anti-tank guns from the 200th Tank Destroyer Battalion.{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=171}}{{sfn|Dunphie|2005|p=45}}{{efn|Trew wrote that there were only around 36 anti-tank guns in the rear positions, including no more than {{nowrap|8–16 pieces}} on the ridge itself.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=64}}}} Most of the LXXXVI Corps artillery was beyond the ridge covering the Caen–Falaise road.{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=171}}{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=63–64}}

Facing Caen to the west of the Caen–Falaise road was the [[I SS Panzer Corps]]. On 14 July, elements of the [[272nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|272nd Infantry Division]] took over the defence of [[Vaucelles]] from the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, who moved into local reserve between the village of [[Ifs, Calvados|Ifs]] and the east bank of the Orne. The following day the 12th SS Panzer Division was placed in ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (''OKW'') reserve to rest and refit and—on Hitler's orders—to be in a position to meet a feared second Allied landing between the Orne and [[Seine]] rivers.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=57}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|pp=166, 171}} The divisional artillery regiment and anti-aircraft battalion remained behind to support the 272nd Infantry Division and two battle groups were detached from the division. ''Kampfgruppe'' Waldmüller was moved close to Falaise and ''Kampfgruppe'' Wünsche to [[Lisieux]], {{convert|40|km|mi}} east of Caen.

{{Main|Second Battle of the Odon}}

====Operation Greenline====

Operation Greenline was launched by XII Corps during the evening of 15 July, with the [[15th (Scottish) Infantry Division]] reinforced by a brigade of [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division]], the 34th Tank Brigade, [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]] and the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division, minus one brigade.{{sfn|Reynolds|2002|p=46}} Greenline was intended to convince the German command that the main British assault would be launched west of the Orne, through the positions held by XII Corps and to tie down the [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen|9th]] and [[10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg|10th]] SS Panzer divisions, so that they could not oppose Goodwood or Cobra.{{sfn|Daglish|2005|p=38}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2002|p=46}} Supported by {{nowrap|450 guns,}} the British attack made use of "artificial moonlight" and started well despite disruption caused by German artillery fire.{{efn|"Artificial moonlight" or "Monty's moonlight" was the term given to the technique of providing illumination at night by reflecting [[searchlight]] beams off the cloud layer.{{sfn|Reynolds|2002|p=47}}}} By dawn XII Corps had captured several of its objectives including the important height of {{nowrap|Hill 113,}} although the much-contested [[Hill 112]] remained in German hands. By committing the 9th SS Panzer Division, the Germans managed by the end of the day to largely restore their line, although a counter-attack against Hill 113 failed.{{sfn|Reynolds|2002|pp=46–48}} Attacks next day by XII Corps gained no further ground and during the evening of 17 July, the operation was closed down and the British force on Hill 113 withdrawn.{{sfn|Reynolds|2002|pp=49–50}}

====Operation Pomegranate====
[[File:Odon valley 16 july.jpg|thumb|{{centre|British Infantry occupy slit trenches between Hill 112 and Hill 113 on 16 July 1944.}}]]
Operation Pomegranate began on 16 July, in which XXX Corps was to capture several important villages.{{sfn|Daglish|2005|p=38}} On the first day British infantry seized a key objective and took {{nowrap|300 prisoners}} but the next day there was much inconclusive fighting on the outskirts of Noyers-Bocage and Elements of the 9th SS Panzer Division were committed to the village defence. Although the British took control of the railway station and an area of high ground outside the village, Noyers-Bocage itself remained in German hands.{{ sfn|Ellis|2004|p=334}}{{sfn|Randel|2006|p=17}}

The preliminary operations cost Second Army {{nowrap|3,500 casualties}} for no significant territorial gains but Greenline and Pomegranate were strategically successful.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=52}} Reacting to the threats in the Odon Valley, the Germans retained the 2nd Panzer and 10th SS Panzer divisions in the front line and recalled the 9th SS Panzer Division from Corps reserve.{{sfn|Daglish|2005|p=38}}{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=334}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2002|p=50}} The Germans suffered around {{nowrap|2,000 casualties.}} Terry Copp wrote that the fighting was "one of the bloodiest encounters of the campaign".{{sfn|Copp|2004|p=135}} During the late afternoon of 17 July, a patrolling Spitfire spotted a German [[staff car]] on the road near the village of [[Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery]].

As the division moved off, more artillery opened fire on Cuverville, Demouville, Giberville, Liberville, Cagny and Émiéville and dropped harassing fire on targets as far south as Garcelles-Secqueville and Secqueville la Campagne. Fifteen minutes later, American heavy bombers dropped {{convert|1340|LT|t}} of fragmentation bombs in the Troarn area and on the main German gun line on the Bourguébus Ridge.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=73, 72}} Only {{nowrap|25 bombers}} in the three waves were lost, all to German anti aircraft fire.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=94}}  Aerial support for the operation was then handed over to 800 fighter-bombers of RAF [[No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group (United Kingdom)|83]] and 84 Groups.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=72}}

The bombing put the 22nd Panzer Regiment and the III Company, 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion temporarily out of action, causing varying degrees of damage to their tanks.

By 08:05, the 2nd [[Fife and Forfar Yeomanry]] and the [[3rd Royal Tank Regiment]] of the 29th Armoured Brigade, had navigated minefields, to reach the Caen–Troarn railway line.{{sfn|Dunphie|2005|p=62}}{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=77}} The first phase of the rolling barrage ended at 08:30, by which time large numbers of prisoners from the 16th ''Luftwaffe'' Division had been rounded up.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=94}}{{sfn|Dunphie|2005|p=62}} By the time the artillery resumed firing at 08:50, only the first armoured regiment and a portion of the second had crossed the line.

As the 2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry advanced past Cagny, they were engaged by anti-tank guns in Cagny to the east.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=80}}{{sfn|Napier|2015|p=249}}&lt;!--
{{efn|Hans von Luck wrote that he was responsible for this barrage of anti-tank fire, saying that he used his sidearm to threaten a ''Luftwaffe'' officer into action, to fire upon the advancing tanks with 88 mm ''flak'' guns.{{sfn|Buckley|2013|p=105}} Luck's account has been widely repeated.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=80}}{{sfn|D'Este|2004|p=375}} The VIII Corps history states that German anti-tank guns in Soliers, which had escaped the aerial bombardment, were responsible.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=98}} In 2001, Reynolds wrote that the losses were a result of the actions of the 200th Assault Gun Battalion.{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=175}} Daglish wrote that "there turns out to be surprisingly little" evidence to support Luck's account and that all accounts of {{nowrap|88 mm}} ''flak'' guns in Cagny being used in an anti-tank capacity "can be traced directly to Luck and no one else". Daglish in 2005, wrote that neither the commander of the ''StuG abteilung 200'' (200th Assault Gun Battalion) or the commander of the ''Luftwaffe flak'' guns made any comment in regards to this action and that based on locations of ''flak'' positions, it was illogical for a heavy ''flak'' battery to have been located there.{{sfn|Daglish|2005|pp=255, 258–261}} Daglish also wrote that Luck's account of the placement of the guns "is imprecise" and "expert analysis of aerial photographs of the area taken at midday ... reveals no trace of [the battery] nor of any towing vehicles or their distinctive tracks". Such weapons and vehicles "could not be hidden within a mere couple of hours of relocation".{{sfn|Daglish|2005|p=256}} Daglish wrote that Luck embellished his role during post-war official British tours of the battlefield, with his version of events eventually coming into question (informally).{{sfn|Daglish|2005|p=258}} Daglish wrote that elements of the 200th Assault Gun Battalion were in the area and that any number of German anti-tank guns could have fired on the 2nd Fife and Forfar and that {{nowrap|88 mm}} anti-tank guns were deployed to the Cagny area throughout the day.{{sfn|Daglish|2005|pp=260, 186}} In 2013, Buckley wrote that Luck's account is "colourful and enthralling" and despite there being "no doubt that heavy anti-tank gunfire from in and around Cagny began to account for British tanks", no evidence that the ''Luftwaffe'' had guns in Cagny at the time, given the dispositions of other ''Luftwaffe'' batteries; Buckley wrote that Luck had embroidered his role.{{sfn|Buckley|2013|p=105}} In 2015, Napier reassessed these criticisms and wrote that "heavy anti-aircraft guns were located in the outlying villages of Caen" and "photographic evidence of the ''Luftwaffe'' batteries in the area exists". Wreckage of three 88 mm guns were found by the Guards Armoured Division that afternoon in Cagny, which would corroborate von Luck's claim to have ordered the destruction of the guns upon abandoning Cagny. Napier wrote that von Luck's account of threatening a ''Luftwaffe'' officer is plausible given that "88 mm anti-aircraft crews did not expect to become embroiled in fighting as per III ''Flak Korps'' policy and their direct involvement occasionally took some persuasion". Napier also wrote that the timeline of von Luck's confrontation with the ''Luftwaffe'' battery commander, just after 09:00 hours, correlates with the losses the 2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry at 09:30 hours, since "a {{nowrap|88 mm}} ''flak'' battery would only need about 15 minutes to relocate a short distance". Napier wrote that the fact that two Tiger tanks were destroyed by German friendly fire "suggests the actions of an inexperienced ''Luftwaffe'' crew", unable to identify retreating German tanks. According to Napier the {{nowrap|75 mm}} Pak 40 anti-tank guns were incapable of the clean armour penetrations found on the Tigers at that range and the only other alternative unit that could have engaged the British tanks was Becker's 4th Battery located in Le Mensnil Frementel. "If this company did not move before 09:30 hours, it would have been cut off when the leading tanks of the 29th brigade crossed the railway." and since the battery "...was able to relocate successfully to just south of Four where it was in action for the rest of the day and so must have moved well before 09:30 hours". Napier wrote that an officer of the 2nd Fife and Forfar wrote in his memoirs "of his surprise at seeing a German officer in dress uniform surveying the battlefield from Cagny". Napier concluded that Von Luck "...correctly attributed credit where it was due and his only sin is the assumption of a mantle previously worn by Rommel who stopped the British tank attack at Arras in 1940 by ordering the 88 mm ''flak'' guns to engage the ground targets of the British tank forces".{{sfn|Napier|2015|pp=247–251}}}}--&gt; Within a few minutes at least twelve tanks were disabled.{{sfn|Dunphie|2005|p=74}} The Yeomanry pressed their advance south and were engaged by the main German gun line on the ridge, while the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment having shifted westward and exchanged fire with the German garrison in Grentheville, before moving around the village and advancing along the southern outskirts of Caen, towards Bras and Hubert-Folie. What had been conceived as an attack towards the Bourguébus Ridge by three armoured divisions, had become an unsupported advance by two tank regiments, out of sight of one other, against heavy German fire. By 11:15, the British reached the ridge and the villages of Bras and Bourguébus. Some losses were inflicted on the German tanks but attempts to advance further were met by determined opposition, including fire from the rear from pockets of resistance that had been bypassed.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=80, 82}}{{sfn|Fortin|2004|p=17}}

General Eberbach ordered a counter-attack, "not a defensive move but a full armoured charge". The 1st SS Panzer Division was to attack across the ridge, while in the Cagny area the 21st Panzer Division was to recover all lost ground. German tanks started to arrive on the ridge around noon and the British tank crews were soon reporting German tanks and guns everywhere. [[Hawker Typhoon]] fighter-bombers carrying [[RP-3]] rockets were directed onto the ridge throughout the afternoon, delaying and eventually breaking up the 1st SS Panzer Division counter-attack.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=80–82}} A final attempt to storm the ridge resulted in the loss of {{nowrap|16 British}} tanks and a small counter-attack during the afternoon was driven off, with the destruction of six German Panthers.{{sfn|Fortin|2004|pp=17–18}}

The Sherman crew fired into the Tiger and then rammed it; anti-tank fire from other British units then penetrated the Tiger's armour. Both crews abandoned their vehicles and most of the German crew was captured.{{sfn|Daglish|2005|pp=177–178}} The 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion later attacked the Coldstream Guards but was forced to withdraw by massed anti-tank fire.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=83}} It took the Guards the rest of the day to capture Cagny, which was found abandoned when infantry entered the village. Attempts to renew the advance were met by fierce German resistance.{{sfn|Dunphie|2005|pp=123–126}} Starting last, the only element of the 7th Armoured Division to enter the battle was the [[5th Royal Tank Regiment]] (5th RTR). At 17:00 near Cuverville it knocked out two Panzer IVs for the loss of four tanks and then cleared Grentheville which had been bypassed earlier in the day by the 3rd RTR and several prisoners were taken.{{sfn|Fortin|2004|p=8}} A German counter-attack by six tanks petered out after two tanks each were destroyed.{{sfn|Lindsay|2005|p=48}}

The 11th Armoured Division pulled back to the Caen–Vimont railway line for the evening and replacement tanks were brought forward for all divisions, with the 11th Armoured taking priority.{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=179}} German recovery teams went forward to recover and repair as many of their tanks as possible, as few replacements were available. Unnoticed by the British, a gap had been created between Emièville and Troan. This was closed during the night by the 12th SS Panzer Division, which had lost ten tanks en route to air attacks.{{sfn|Beevor|2014|pp=319–320}} A number of minor German counter-attacks were launched from the ridge; one at dusk was broken up by British artillery and anti-tank fire, which destroyed a Panther and Tiger, another after dark, led by a captured Sherman as a ruse, was repulsed after the Sherman and two Panthers were knocked out by a British anti-tank battery.{{sfn|Dunphie|2005|p=144}} During the night, German bombers dropped flares over the Orne bridges, which then came under aerial attack.

Tactically, the Germans contained the offensive, holding many of their main positions and preventing an Allied breakthrough but they had been startled by the weight of the attack and preliminary aerial bombardment.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=352}} It was clear that any defensive system less than {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} deep could be overwhelmed at a stroke and the Germans could afford to man their defences in such depth only in the sector south of Caen.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=264}} Goodwood resulted in the British extending their control over an extra {{convert|7|mi|km|abbr=on}} depth of territory to the east of Caen, with the penetration being as much as {{convert|12000|yd|m}} in some places; the southern suburbs of Caen had been captured by the Canadians during Operation Atlantic.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=131}}{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=94}}

The attack reinforced the German view that the greatest danger was on the eastern flank. As German armoured reinforcements arrived in Normandy, they were drawn into defensive battles in the east and worn down. By the end of July only one and a half panzer divisions were facing American forces at the western end of the front, compared with six and a half facing the British and Canadians at the eastern end of the bridgehead. The German defence of Normandy was close to collapse when Operation Cobra breached the thin German defensive 'crust' in the west and few German mechanised units were available to counter-attack.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=185}} Martin Blumenson, the American official historian, wrote after the war that had Goodwood created a breakthrough, "... Cobra would probably have been unnecessary".{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|p=188}} Goodwood inflicted substantial losses on the German defenders but not a shattering blow. The effect on the morale of the German commanders was greater and added to the loss of Rommel, who was wounded in an RAF air attack. Kluge lost his early optimism on being appointed to replace Rundstedt and wrote to Hitler on 21 July predicting an imminent collapse.{{sfn|Buckley|2014|p=110}}

Operation Goodwood was launched at a time of great frustration in the higher command of the Allies, which contributed to the controversy surrounding the operation. The Allied bridgehead was about 20 percent of the planned size, which led to congestion and some fear of a stalemate.{{sfn|Blumenson|1961|pp=4–6, 119, 186}} Allied commanders had not been able to exploit their potentially decisive advantages in mobility during June and early July 1944. Much of the controversy surrounding the objectives of the battle originates from the conflicting messages given by Montgomery. He talked up the objectives of Goodwood to the press on the first day, later saying that this was propaganda to encourage the Germans to keep powerful units at the east end of the battlefield.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=355–356}}

In the planning of Goodwood, Montgomery appeared to promise that the attack would be a breakthrough and that when the VIII Corps failed to break-out, by some accounts the Supreme Commander, US General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] felt he had been misled. While his intermittent communications to [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) appeared to promise a breakthrough, Montgomery was writing orders to his subordinates for a limited attack. Copies of orders forwarded to SHAEF, called for an armoured division to take Falaise, a town far in the German rear. Three days prior to the attack, Montgomery revised the orders, eliminating Falaise as an objective but neglected to forward copies of the revision; Eisenhower was later furious at the result, which dogged Montgomery, as it allowed his detractors, especially Air Marshal [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Arthur Tedder]], to imply that the operation was a failure.{{sfn|Williams|2004|p=174}}

[[Stephen Biddle]] wrote that Goodwood was a significant tactical setback for Montgomery. Despite having preponderant force and air superiority, British progress was slow and ultimately failed to break through. Montgomery chose an unusually narrow spearhead of just {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}}, which created a congested line of advance. British infantry was lacking in suitable junior officers and non-commissioned officers, which inhibited small-unit tactics. In Biddle's analysis,

{{quote|The British systematically failed to [[combined arms|coordinate movement and suppressive fires]] after about mid-morning of the opening day.... The attack had by then moved beyond the reach of the British batteries on the northern side of the Orne River and the congestion in the march columns had kept the artillery from moving forward into supporting range.... The net result was thus an exposed, massed, nearly pure-tank assault pressing forward rapidly without supporting infantry or supporting suppressive fires.|Biddle{{sfn|Biddle|2006|pp=121–125}}}}

The Germans, by contrast, made great efforts to conceal their forces—moving under cover of dark, off the main roads, in small units and under radio silence.{{sfn|Biddle|2006|pp=121–125}}

===Casualties===
Simon Trew wrote that "the first estimates of Allied losses for Operation Goodwood appeared horrific, that Second Army had lost {{nowrap|4,011 men... ."}}{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=97}} G. S. Jackson gave losses in the armoured divisions from {{nowrap|18–19 July,}} as {{nowrap|1,020 men.}}{{sfn|Jackson|2006|pp=103, 108}} Michael Reynolds quoted the 21st Army Group war diary of casualties in I and VIII Corps of {{nowrap|3,474 men.}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=186}} Operation Atlantic cost the Canadians from {{nowrap|1,349–1,965 casualties.}}{{sfn|Copp|2007|p=5}}{{sfn|Zuehlke|2001|p=166}} Colonel Charles Perry Stacey gave casualties of all Canadian units in Europe, for the four days' fighting as {{nowrap|1,965 in}} all categories; {{nowrap|441 men}} were killed or died of wounds.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=176}} Trew wrote that "no conclusive assessment can ever be made" in regards to the losses of both sides. In 2014, John Buckley gave a figure of {{nowrap|5,500 casualties}} during Goodwood and Atlantic.{{sfn|Buckley|2014|p=109}}

During Operation Goodwood, over {{nowrap|2,000 German}} prisoners were taken and {{circa|100}} tanks were destroyed.{{sfn|Trew|2004|pp=96–97}} Jackson also wrote of {{circa|100 German}} tank losses.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=113}} In the official history Major [[Lionel Ellis]] wrote that the 1st SS and 21st Panzer divisions lost {{nowrap|109 tanks}} on the first day of the battle.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=346}} Reynolds recorded {{nowrap|77 German}} tanks or assault guns knocked out or damaged during the operation and that the claim of {{nowrap|75 tanks}} or assault guns destroyed—as stated in a post-war interview, by the commanding officer of the 11th Armoured Division, for a British staff college training film on the operation—"can be accepted as accurate".{{sfn|Reynolds|2001|p=187}} Michael Tamelander wrote that [[5th Panzer Army|''Panzergruppe West'']] recorded the loss of {{nowrap|75 tanks}} during the period from {{nowrap|16–21 July.}}{{sfn|Tamelander|Zetterling|2004|p=289}}

British tank losses during Goodwood have been debated, with tank losses being reported from {{nowrap|300–500.}}{{sfn|Tamelander|Zetterling|2004|p=288}} In addition to VIII Corps losses, about twenty tanks were lost in the flanking operations.{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=98}} Reynolds wrote that study of the records suggests that the maximum number of tanks lost during Operation Goodwood was {{nowrap|253, most}} of which were damaged rather than write-offs.{{sfn|Reynolds|2001| p=186}} Tamelander and Niklas Zetterling wrote that during Goodwood 469&amp;nbsp;tanks were lost by the armoured divisions (including 131&amp;nbsp;tanks on the 19 July and 68 on the 20 July), but that the majority could be repaired.{{sfn|Tamelander|Zetterling|2004|p=288}} Trew rejected those figures and wrote that after much investigation, VIII Corps losses amounted to 197 tanks on 18 July, 99&amp;nbsp;tanks on 19 July and {{nowrap|18 tanks}} on 20 July, "for a total of {{nowrap|314, of}} which {{nowrap|130 were}} completely destroyed". Trew wrote that "the tank strength returns for VIII Corps {{nowrap|18–21 July}} show a loss of 218 tanks (that could not be repaired or immediately replaced), including 145 tanks from 11th Armoured Division".{{sfn|Trew|2004|p=98}} In 2014 Buckley wrote that 400 British tanks were knocked out and that many were recovered and put back into service, although the morale of some of the crews deteriorated.{{sfn|Buckley|2014|p=109}}
