The '''Battle of Tuchola Forest''' ({{lang-de|Schlacht in der Tucheler Heide}}, {{lang-pl|Bitwa w Borach Tucholskich}}) was one of [[Battle of the Border|the first battles]] of [[World War II]], during the 1939 [[invasion of Poland]]. The battle began 1 September and ended 5 September with a major [[Germany|German]] victory. Thanks to poor [[Poland|Polish]] [[command and control]], as well as German numerical and tactical superiority, the Germans managed to cripple Poland's [[Pomorze Army|Army Pomerania]] and, by breaking through the [[Polish Corridor]], to connect mainland Germany with [[East Prussia]].&lt;ref name="JnM"&gt;[[Christer Jörgensen]], Chris Mann, ''Strategy and Tactics: Tank Warfare'', Zenith Imprint, 2001, {{ISBN|0-7603-1016-5}}, p. 35. [https://books.google.com/books?q=Christer+Jorgensen%2C+Chris+Mann&amp;btnG=Search+Books Google Print]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The battle was fought against the judgment of General [[Wladyslaw Bortnowski]], the commander of Army Pomerania, who believed the Corridor to be a very poor defensive position and had repeatedly asked for permission to withdraw his forces from it.&lt;ref&gt;(in Polish) R. Ziobroń, ''Historia żołnierza tułacza. Działalność emigracyjna gen. Władysława Bortnowskiego'', Rzeszów, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tuchola Forest]] ({{lang-pl|Bory Tucholskie}}, {{lang-de|Tucheler Heide}}) in Westprussia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Westpreu%C3%9Fen_und_DanzigerBucht.png 1896 Map of West-East Prussia with Tucheler Heide south of Danziger Bucht Bay]&lt;/ref&gt; since 1920 [[Treaty of Versailles]] in the [[Polish Corridor]], is a large area of mostly [[forest]]. Its difficult terrain was thought by the Polish high command as a good defensive position. However, the Germans had held their ''Truppenübungsplatz Gruppe'' military exercises in the area until 1919, and were therefore familiar with it, and furthermore General [[Heinz Guderian]] had been born in nearby [[Chełmno|Kulm]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinz Guderian]]: Erinnerungen eines Soldaten, ''"Ich hatte am 3.9 ... meinen Sohn Kurt wiedergesehen und mich dabei an den Türmen von Kulm, meiner Geburtsstadt, erfreut, die vom Ostufer der Weichsel herüberwinkten. Am 4.9 ... bei ihren Waldgefechten und endete auf dem alten deutschen Truppenübungsplatz Gruppe westlich Graudenz."'', 1951,[https://books.google.com/books?id=vn4ZAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22truppen%C3%BCbungsplatz+gruppe%22&amp;q=%22truppen%C3%BCbungsplatz+gruppe%22&amp;pgis=1#search]&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish forces in the theater comprised elements of the Pomeranian Army: [[Polish 9th Infantry Division|9th Infantry Division]] under colonel [[Józef Werobej]], the [[Polish 27th Infantry Division|27th Infantry Division]]&lt;ref name=Zaloga&gt;Zaloga, S.J., 2002, Poland 1939, Oxford: Osprey Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|9781841764085}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}} under general [[Juliusz Drapella]], and [[Czersk Operational Group]] under gen. [[Stanisław Grzmot-Skotnicki]].

German forces in the theater were composed of elements of the [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th German Army]] under general [[Günther von Kluge]], specifically [[19th Panzer Corps]] (commanded by general [[Heinz Guderian]]), and 2nd Army Corps under general [[Adolf Strauss (general)|Adolf Strauß]]. Those units were based in [[Western Pomerania]] west of the corridor.

19th Panzer Corps consisted of the [[2nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Motorized Division]] under general [[Paul Bader]], the [[20th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|20th Motorized Division]] under general [[Mauritz von Wiktorin]] and the [[3rd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|3rd Panzer Division]] under general [[Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg]]. 2nd Army Corps was composed of two infantry divisions: the [[3rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|3rd Infantry Division]] under general [[Walter Lichel]] and [[32nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|32nd Infantry Division]] under general [[Franz Böhme]].

== Battle ==
Despite several tactical Polish victories, including the successful [[Polish cavalry|cavalry]] charge at [[Skirmish of Krojanty|Krojanty]] on 1 September, and the destruction of a German [[armored train]] near [[Chojnice]], the German armies were able to advance quickly. Not all Polish forces were in position by 1 September and the rapid German advance generated confusion in the Polish ranks. In addition, communications problems prevented cohesive action on the part of the scattered Polish forces. The Poles were soon forced to abandon plans for a counterattack and retreated, pursued by more mobile German motorized and armored troops. The German forces had a significant amount of armor support, including over 300 tanks commanded by the famous panzer expert Guderian.

Most Polish units were surrounded by 3 September. Some were destroyed, while others managed to break through towards [[Bydgoszcz]].

== Aftermath ==
By 5 September the Germans had in large part completed their takeover of the Polish Corridor. At that point some German forces moved to erase isolated pockets of Polish resistance further north in fortified areas on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic Coast]], while others continued their push south-east, deeper into Polish territory.

On 6 September, [[Adolf Hitler]] visited Guderian and congratulated him on his swift progress.&lt;ref name="Gilbert "&gt;[[Martin Gilbert]], ''The Second World War: A Complete History'', Owl Books, 2004, {{ISBN|0-8050-7623-9}} [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0805076239&amp;id=Y_sfOn8BkOwC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=tuchola&amp;sig=B-eDHWHuI0QVFHP61nYi_a1O6Y8&amp;hl=en Google Print, p.6]&lt;/ref&gt;
