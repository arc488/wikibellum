The '''Action of 13 May 1944''' refers to the sinking of an [[Imperial Japan]]ese [[submarine]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] during [[World War II]]. An [[United States Navy|American]] [[destroyer escort]] attacked the former [[Kriegsmarine|German]] [[U-boat]] {{GS|U-1224||2}}, which had been given to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] and renamed '''''RO-501'''''. The boat was the first of two Japanese vessels sunk in the [[European Theater of Operations]].

==Action==
Due to arrangements made by German [[Vice Admiral]] [[Paul H. Weneker]] in 1944, a group of Japanese sailors under [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Norita Sadatoshi]] were sent to Germany to receive training in [[submarine warfare]]. After they were given the recently launched ''U-1224'' to sail back to Japan with a precious cargo of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], lead, steel, aluminum drawings, optical glass, blueprints for a [[Type IXC/40 submarine|IXC type U-boat]] and  [[Messerschmitt Me 163]]A ''Komet'' jet aircraft. [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] intelligence discovered that the Japanese were sailing a submarine from Germany to [[Asia]], so [[Task Group 22.2]] (TG&amp;nbsp;22.2) of the [[United States Navy]] was ordered to intercept them. Lieutenant Commander Sadatoshi had no choice but to take his boat around the tip of Africa and this meant passing off the [[Cape Verde Islands]] where TG&amp;nbsp;22.2 operated.&lt;ref name="desausa1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desausa.org/sinking_of_ro_501.htm |title=Sinking of RO 501 |publisher=Desausa.org |date=1944-05-13 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wrecksite1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?57983 |title=RO-501 SUBMARINE 1943-1944 - WRECK WRAK EPAVE WRACK PECIO |publisher=Wrecksite.eu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group included the [[escort carrier]] {{USS|Bogue|CVE-9|6}} and five [[destroyer escort]]s; {{USS|Francis M. Robinson|DE-220|6}}, {{USS|Haverfield|DE-393|2}}, {{USS|Swenning|DE-394|2}}, {{USS|Willis|DE-395|2}} and {{USS|Janssen|DE-396|2}}. TG&amp;nbsp;22.2 was on its first day of operations around the Cape Verdes on 13 May.&lt;ref name="desausa1"/&gt; [[Lieutenant]] [[John E. Johansen]] in ''Robinson'' was patrolling alone a few hundred miles northwest of the Cape Verdes when at sunset about 19:00, her crew made a sound contact with a submarine. Johansen ordered his men to battle stations, and at a range of {{convert|825|yd|m|abbr=on}} the Americans opened fire with [[Hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]] bombs which detonated over the area where the submarine was heard. A few moments later, ''Robinson'' was over the area itself and dropped a series of Mark 8 [[depth charge]]s.&lt;ref name="desausa1"/&gt;

Seven seconds later, two underwater explosions were heard, indicating that some of the hedgehogs hit and damaged ''RO-501''. A few seconds after, three successive explosions from the depth charges sent up huge columns of water. Three minutes later, a loud roar was produced by another large underwater explosion, said to have killed fish up to a quarter of a league from the battle area. Thus, ''RO-501'' was sunk with a loss of all 52 hands at position {{coord|18|8|N|33|13|W|display=inline,title}}, a few miles from where {{USS|Buckley|DE-51|6}} sank {{GS|U-66|1940|2}} after a famous battle.&lt;ref name="desausa1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wrecksite1"/&gt;

Aircraft from TG&amp;nbsp;22.2 later sank a second Japanese boat in the Atlantic, ''[[Japanese submarine I-52 (1943)|I-52]]'', and was one of the most successful U.S. Navy squadrons which operated against submarines during the war. ''Francis M. Robinson'' received the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] and one [[battle star]] for destroying ''RO-501''.
