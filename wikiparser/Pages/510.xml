The '''bombing of Singapore''' was an attack on 8 December 1941 by seventeen [[Mitsubishi G3M|G3M ''Nell'']] bombers of Mihoro Air Group (''Mihoro Kaigun [[Kōkūtai]]''),&lt;ref name="ZERO!"&gt;{{citation |title = Full text of "ZERO!"|url = https://archive.org/stream/zero001449mbp/zero001449mbp_djvu.txt|publisher = E. P. Dutton &amp; Co. r Inc.|accessdate = 20 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|Imperial Japanese Navy]], flying from [[Thu Dau Mot]] in southern [[Indochina]]. The attack began at around 0430, shortly after Japanese forces [[Japanese Invasion of Malaya|landed on Kota Bharu]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]].&lt;ref name="Owen 1"/&gt; It was the first knowledge the [[Singapore]] population had that [[World War II|war]] had broken out in the [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|Far East]].&lt;ref name="Owen 1"/&gt;

==Background==
The attack on Singapore was assigned to 34 bombers of [[Genzan Air Group]] (''Genzan Kaigun Kōkūtai'') and 31 bombers of Mihoro Air Group.&lt;ref name="Burton 1"/&gt; Their targets were [[Tengah Air Base|RAF Tengah]], [[Seletar Airport|RAF Seletar]], [[Singapore Naval Base|Sembawang Naval Base]] and [[Keppel Harbour]].&lt;ref name="Imperial Japanese Navy Air Assault of Singapore"&gt;{{citation|title = Imperial Japanese Navy Air Assault of Singapore|url = http://www.aircraftresourcecenter.com/Fea1/801-900/Fea854_Singapore-Assualt_Yeo/00.shtm|publisher = Mike Yeo|accessdate = 20 January 2010|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100210235021/http://aircraftresourcecenter.com/Fea1/801-900/Fea854_Singapore-Assualt_Yeo/00.shtm#|archive-date = 10 February 2010|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six squadrons from both air groups took off from southern Indochina on the night of 7 December 1941. However, bad weather conditions were encountered while over the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref name="Burton 1"/&gt; Thick clouds offered poor visibility for the pilots, while rough winds caused most of the formations to become separated. After several attempts to regroup failed, [[Lieutenant Commander]] Niichi Nakanishi, [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] of Genzan Air Group, ordered them to abort mission and return to base,&lt;ref name="ZERO!"/&gt; thereby reducing the impact of a much heavier raid.&lt;ref name="Burton 1"/&gt; Only seventeen G3M bombers of Mihoro Air Group reached Singapore on schedule, unobstructed by bad weather.&lt;ref name="ZERO!"/&gt;

===The Attack===
The Japanese formation was detected by a radar station in [[Mersing]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], almost an hour before they reached Singapore. Three [[Brewster Buffalo]] fighters of [[No. 453 Squadron RAAF]] were on standby at [[RAF Sembawang]]. However, Flight Lieutenant [[Tim Vigors]]' request to [[Scrambling (military)|scramble]] and intercept the Japanese bombers was denied.&lt;ref&gt;Stenman and Thomas, page 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Robert Brooke-Popham]] feared that the anti-aircraft batteries would fire on the friendly fighters, despite Vigors being an experienced [[night fighter]] in the [[Battle of Britain]]. He was supplemented by the belief that the Buffalo fighter was only suited for daylight fighting and could not be used at night. Paradoxically, there were 12 [[Bristol Blenheim]] Mark IF night fighters of [[No. 27 Squadron RAF]] stationed in [[Sungai Petani]], Malaya, but were being used as [[ground-attack aircraft]].&lt;ref name="Burton 2"&gt;Burton 2006, page 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The streets were still brightly lit despite [[civil defense siren|air raid siren]]s going off at 0400, allowing pilot [[navigator]]s to locate their targets without difficulty. [[Air Raid Precautions]] (ARP) Headquarters was not even manned, and there was no blackout as police and [[power station]] officials could not find the employee who had the key to the switch (only two practice blackouts were conducted in September 1941 before the raid).&lt;ref name="Owen 1"/&gt; When the bombers began their attack at 0430, Allied anti-aircraft guns immediately opened fire. The battleship [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|''Prince of Wales'']] and battlecruiser [[HMS Repulse (1916)|''Repulse'']] also responded, but no aircraft was shot down. A formation of nine bombers flew over without releasing their bombs to draw the searchlights and anti-aircraft guns away from the other group. They were flying at 12,000 feet, while the second formation was at 4,000 feet.&lt;ref name="Owen 1"&gt;Owen 2001, page 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===

The 'Raiders Passed' signal was sent out at 0500.&lt;ref name="Owen 1"/&gt; The bombers succeeded in bombing the airfields at Seletar and Tengah, damaging three [[Bristol Blenheim]] bombers of [[No. 34 Squadron RAF]].&lt;ref name="Burton 1"/&gt; A number of bombs also fell on [[Raffles Place]]. 61 people were killed and more than 700 were injured. Most of the casualties were troops of the 2/2nd Gurkha Rifles, [[11th Indian Infantry Division]]. The Japanese bombers all returned safely to Thu Dau Mot.&lt;ref name="First bomb raid on Singapore"&gt;{{citation|title = First bomb raid on Singapore|url = http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_7_2005-01-25.html|publisher = Chua, Jeanne|date = 29 September 1997|access-date = 20 January 2010|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081226134341/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_7_2005-01-25.html|archive-date = 26 December 2008|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the bombing caused only minor damage to the airfields, it stunned the [[British Far East Command]]. Despite intelligence reports of Japanese aircraft performance in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the command did not believe Japan's air forces were capable of striking Singapore from airfields more than 600 miles away in Indochina. The raid came as a surprise to [[Lieutenant General]] [[Arthur Percival]], who "hardly expected the Japanese to have any very long-range aircraft."&lt;ref name="Burton 1"&gt;Burton 2006, page 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore had respite from further air raids while the Japanese focussed their attacks on Allied positions in northern Malaya. The next raid occurred on the night of 16/17 December 1941. This was minor attack on RAF Tengah by two Japanese Ki-21s. The next serious raid on Singapore City was on the night of 29/30 December. The Japanese launched their first daylight raid on 12 January 1942, a day after their capture of Kuala Lumpur allowed them to shift aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|IJAAF]] to southern Malaya.
