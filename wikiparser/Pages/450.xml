The '''Japanese occupation of Kiska''' took place between 6 June 1942 and 28 July 1943 during the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] of the [[American Theater (World War II)|American Theater]] and the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]]. The Japanese occupied [[Kiska]] and nearby [[Attu Island]] in order to protect the northern flank of the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]]. Along with the [[Japanese occupation of Attu|Attu landing]] the next day, it was the first time that the [[continental United States]] was occupied by a foreign power since the [[War of 1812]], and was one of the only two [[Invasion of the United States|invasions of the United States]] during World War II.

==Occupation==
Initially, the only American military presence on Kiska was a twelve-man [[United States Navy]] [[weather station]]—two of whom were not present during the invasion—and a dog named Explosion.&lt;ref name="theclio.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theclio.com/web/entry?id=16114|title=Japanese Occupation Site at Kiska Island|publisher=|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hlswilliwaw.com"/&gt; The Japanese stormed the station, killing two Americans and capturing seven. After realizing that [[Chief petty officer]] William C. House had escaped, a search was launched by the occupying forces. The search ended in vain, with House surrendering some fifty days after the initial seizure of the weather station, having been unable to cope with the freezing conditions &amp; starvation. After 50 days of eating only plants and worms, he weighed just 80 pounds.&lt;ref name="theclio.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificwrecks.com/provinces/alaska_kiska ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beforehand, the [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] had been sent to Japan.

The [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and beginning of the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] in [[World War II]], coupled with Japanese threats to mainland Alaska along with the rest of the [[West Coast of the United States|United States West Coast]], had already made the construction of a defense access highway to Alaska a priority. On 6 February 1942, the construction of the [[Alaska Highway]] was approved by the U.S. Army and the project received the authorization from the U.S. Congress and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to proceed five days later.

Reacting to the Japanese occupation, American and Allied forces waged a continuous air bombardment campaign against the Japanese forces on Kiska. Also, U.S. Navy warships blockaded and periodically bombarded the island. Several Japanese warships, transport ships, and submarines attempting to travel to Kiska or Attu were sunk or damaged by the blockading forces.

=== Japanese evacuation and Allied casualties===

{{main|Operation Cottage}}
In May 1943, U.S. forces landed on Attu in [[Battle of Attu|Operation Landcrab]] and subsequently destroyed the Japanese garrison there. In response, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] successfully evacuated the island of Kiska ending the Japanese presence in the Aleutian Islands.

On July 29, 1943, Rear Admiral Kimura Masatomi, commanding two light cruisers and ten destroyers, slipped through the American blockade under the cover of fog and rescued 5,193 men. The operation was run by light cruisers Abukuma (1.212 men) and Kiso (1.189 men), and destroyers Yugumo (479 men), Kazagumo (478 men), Usugumo (478 men), Asagumo (476 men), Akigumo (463 men) and Hibiki (418 men). The destroyers Hatsushimo, Naganami, Shimakaze and Samidare gave cover to the operation. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.combinedfleet.com, entries about the participating ships&lt;/ref&gt;

Not completely sure that the Japanese were gone, the Americans and Canadians executed an unopposed landing on Kiska on 15 August, securing the island and ending the Aleutian Islands campaign. After the landing, the soldiers were greeted by a group of dogs who had been left behind. Among them was Explosion, who had been cared for by the Japanese.

Over 313 Allied casualties resulted from this attack on the unoccupied island, due to [[friendly fire]], accidents, landmines, and booby traps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nps.gov/aleu/learn/historyculture/upload/Kiska-reprint-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naval operations==
On 19 June 1942, American aircraft attacked and sank the Japanese oiler ''[[Nissan Maru]]'' in [[Kiska Harbor]] and on 30 June American naval forces bombarded the island. The American [[submarine]] {{USS|Growler|SS-215|6}} [[Action of 5 July 1942|attacked]] and sank one Japanese destroyer {{convert|7|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} east of Kiska Harbor on 5 July, two other destroyers were also heavily damaged. Over 200 Japanese sailors were killed or wounded while the Americans sustained no losses, it became the single bloodiest engagement during the operations on and around Kiska. {{USS|Grunion|SS-216|6}} was attacked by three Japanese submarine chasers while patrolling Kiska Harbor on 15 July. In response, she fired on and sank two of the Japanese ships and damaged the third. ''Grunion'' was lost a few weeks later off Kiska on 30 July with all hands, she is suspected of being sunk after one of her own torpedoes circled back when she attacked the ''Kano Maru''.

On 8 August, the Japanese [[cargo ship]] ''Kano Maru'' was sunk at Kiska Harbor by [[PBY Catalina]]s. Days before, the cargo ship was damaged by one of ''Grunion''{{'}}s torpedoes. [[Troopship]] ''Nozima Maru'' was also bombed and sunk in Kiska Harbor on 15 September. On 5 October, the Japanese [[steamship|steamer]] ''Borneo Maru'' was sunk at [[Gertrude Cove]] and on the 17th, the destroyer ''Oboro'' was sunk by American aircraft. {{Ship|Japanese submarine|RO-65||2}} sank off Kiska on 4 November, ''Montreal Maru'' on 6 January 1943, and ''Uragio Maru'' on 4 April. {{Ship|Japanese submarine|I-7||2}} was grounded and abandoned by her crew on 23 June while assisting in removing Kiska's garrison. She was chased onto the rocks by {{USS|Monaghan|DD-354|6}}.
