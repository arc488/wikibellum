The '''Riga Offensive''' (known in ({{lang-ru|Рижская наступательная операция}}, the '''Riga Offensive Operation''' &amp;mdash; its formal Soviet title) was part of the larger [[Baltic Offensive]] on the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]] during [[World War II]]. It took place late in 1944, and drove German forces from the city of [[Riga]].

==Prelude==
{{Main article|Operation Bagration|Tartu Offensive}}
Soviet forces had advanced towards the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast in the beginning of their [[Tartu Offensive]] and at the end of the highly successful [[Belorussian Offensive]] (Operation Bagration), during July and August 1944, and at one point had broken through to the [[Gulf of Riga]]. The victories in July were highly unexpected, and at one point on July 31, the commander of the 8th mechanized brigade communicated with corps headquarters to notify them that its tanks had reached the beach. In an unusual act, they were ordered to fill several bottles of sea water, have them signed, and flown to [[Moscow Kremlin|The Kremlin]] as proof that [[Army Group North]] had been cut off from [[Nazi Germany|the Reich.]] During August, the German [[18th Army (Wehrmacht)|18th Army]] had mounted a counter-attack, [[Operation Doppelkopf]]. Simultaneously the German [[Valga, Estonia|Valga]]–[[Võrtsjärv]] line, supported by the local Estonian [[Omakaitse]] militia battalions, repelled the heavy pressure of the Soviet 3rd Baltic Front's Tartu Offensive.&lt;ref name=laar2/&gt; The German [[Army Group North]]'s commander, [[Ferdinand Schörner]] designed [[Operation Aster]] to pull his troops out of mainland Estonia. The parallel Riga Offensive would see Soviet forces apply further pressure on Army Group North, which still held much of Latvia and Estonia.

==The offensive==
The Soviet forces launched a ferocious attack on the Riga axis on September 14, 1944. Within 4 days, the German 16th Army had suffered serious damage, while in the 18th Army's sector, ten of the eighteen German divisions had been reduced to the ''[[Kampfgruppe]]'' level.&lt;ref name=mitchamp150&gt;Mitcham, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; In the northern segment placed along Lake [[Võrtsjärv]], and the [[Väike Emajõgi]] and [[Gauja]] rivers, the Soviet 3rd Baltic Front attacked the German [[XXVIII Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XXVIII Army Corps]] backed by [[Omakaitse]] battalions.&lt;ref name=hiio&gt;{{cite book|author=[[:et:Toomas Hiio|Toomas Hiio]]|year=2006|title=Combat in Estonia in 1944. In: Toomas Hiio, Meelis Maripuu, [[:et:Indrek Paavle|Indrek Paavle]] (Eds.). Estonia 1940–1945: Reports of the Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity|location=Tallinn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fierce battles, the German and Estonian units held their positions.&lt;ref name=laar2&gt;{{cite book |title=Estonia in World War II |last=Laar |first=Mart |year=2005 |publisher=Grenader| authorlink=Mart Laar|location=Tallinn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the south, the [[43rd Army (Soviet Union)|43rd Army]] was threatening the approaches to Riga itself, where the German [[X Corps (Germany)|X Corps]] had been shattered.&lt;ref name=mitchamp150&gt;Mitcham, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; Schoerner began to move his divisions into the [[Courland Peninsula]], intending to shorten the front and pull back from Riga. A counter-attack was carried out by the [[XXXIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXIX Panzer Corps]] of [[3rd Panzer Army]], temporarily placed under Schörner's overall command, but the Soviet opposition was too strong.&lt;ref name=mitchamp148&gt;Mitcham, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, ''[[Stavka]]'' had been preparing a new axis of attack under the cover of a further push towards Riga, the new plan being put forward in a directive of September 24.&lt;ref name=glantzp433&gt;Glantz, p.433&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, the [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|16th Army]] began to report Soviet traffic ''away'' from its front, to the south-west.&lt;ref name=mitchamp150&gt;Mitcham, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, several major Soviet force concentrations (notably the [[4th Shock Army (Soviet Union)|4th Shock]] and [[51st Army (Soviet Union)|51st]] Armies) were being shifted southwards in preparation for a major thrust westwards towards [[Klaipėda|Memel]] by the [[1st Baltic Front]]. German intelligence detected the movement of several of the armies involved, but were unable to detect their destination.&lt;ref name=glantzp440&gt;Glantz, p.440&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting offensive, the [[Battle of Memel]], was launched on October 5; [[Hovhannes Bagramyan|Bagramyan's]] [[1st Baltic Front]] shattered the [[3rd Panzer Army|Third Panzer Army]], finally severing the land connection between the German [[Army Group Centre]] and [[Army Group North]]. Schoerner's forces around Riga and in Courland were now cut off.

On October 9, Schoerner signalled that he would attack towards Memel and try and re-establish the land connection if Riga could be evacuated.&lt;ref name=mitchamp152&gt;Mitcham, p.152&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet forces were again moving forwards outside Riga, and brought the city within the range of artillery fire on October 10. Leaving a screening force of the [[227th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|227th Infantry Division]] and the guns of the [[6th Motorized Anti-Aircraft Division (Germany)|6th Motorized Anti-Aircraft Division]], the [[18th Army (Wehrmacht)|18th Army]] retreated through Riga into Courland, destroying bridges on its route.&lt;ref name=mitchamp152&gt;Mitcham, p.152&lt;/ref&gt; Riga was taken by forces of the [[3rd Baltic Front]] on October 13. Over the next few days Soviet units were reported in action to the west of Riga, stating that German forces had been cleared from the eastern bank of the [[Lielupe]] River by October 17.&lt;ref name=RIA&gt;[http://eng.9may.ru/17.10.1944/eng_inform/m9002556 RIA Novosti Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Army Group North had been driven into the [[Courland Pocket]], where it remained isolated until the end of the war in Europe.
