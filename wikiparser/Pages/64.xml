'''Operation Substance''' was a British naval operation in July 1941 during the [[Second World War]] to escort convoy GM 1, the first of the series from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;Hague, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; The convoy defended by [[Force H]] was attacked by Italian [[submarine]]s, aircraft, and [[MAS (boat)|''Motoscafo armato silurante'']] (MAS boats).

==The convoy==
The convoy of six [[cargo ship]]s carried one light and one heavy anti-aircraft regiment with 30 field guns to strengthen the island against possible airborne assault.&lt;ref name=g&amp;m&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, pp.178&amp;179&lt;/ref&gt; Medical personnel expected to be needed in the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|forthcoming siege]] were also embarked.&lt;ref name=norm&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10526185/Dr-Norman-Mawby-obituaries.html|title=Dr Norman Mawby – obituaries|work=Daily Telegraph|date=25 Dec 2013|accessdate=26 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Force H included the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Nelson|28|6}}, the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}, the fast [[minelayer]] {{HMS|Manxman|M70|6}}, [[cruiser]]s {{HMS|Manchester|15|6}}, {{HMS|Edinburgh|16|2}} and {{HMS|Arethusa|26|2}} with eight [[destroyer]]s and the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} operating 21 [[Fairey Fulmar]]s and carrying seven [[Fairey Swordfish]] to be flown off as reinforcements to Malta.&lt;ref name=g&amp;m/&gt;

==Prelude==
The [[Royal Navy]] observed decreasing intensity of ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' attacks as the [[torpedo]] inventory at [[Sardinia]]n airfields was nearly exhausted. The ships of convoy GM 1 sailed from the [[British Isles]] on 13 July 1941 as part of convoy WS ('''W'''inston '''S'''pecials) 9C, and arrived at Gibraltar on 20 July.&lt;ref name=hag&gt;Hague, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; Ships of the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] operating from [[Alexandria]] began making heavy radio traffic in the hope of diverting attention to possible preparations for a major operation in the eastern [[Mediterranean]]. Eight [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] submarines were deployed off Italian naval bases; but the Italian fleet assumed the convoy was merely ''Ark Royal'' flying-off replacement aircraft to Malta, and chose to remain in port. ''Leinster'' ran aground while leaving Gibraltar on 21 July and had to return to port. The {{sclass-|Perla|submarine}} {{ship|Italian submarine|Diaspro||2}} found the convoy on 22 July and launched torpedoes which narrowly missed ''Renown'' and {{HMAS|Nestor||6}}.&lt;ref name=g&amp;m/&gt;

==Battle of 23 July==
[[File:HMS Fearless (H67) IWM FL 013091.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Fearless|H67|6}} was sunk by a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] while escorting convoy GM 1.]]
The convoy came under low level attack by nine [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] torpedo bombers coordinated with five [[CANT Z.1007]] high level bombers. Four Fulmars met the torpedo planes head-on and shot one down before another SM.79 launched a torpedo which hit ''Manchester'' before also being shot down. ''Ark Royal'' launched seven more Fulmars which were unable to engage the high level bombers before they released bombs which failed to hit the convoyed ships. Three Fulmars were shot down. A later attack by two SM.79s sank {{HMS|Fearless|H67|6}} killing 35 of her crew. Another bombing attack near-missed {{HMS|Firedrake|H79|6}} causing damage requiring the destroyer to be towed back to Gibraltar. [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s from Malta assisted ''Ark Royal'' Fulmars defending the convoy from these attacks.&lt;ref name=g&amp;m/&gt;

{{HMS|Cossack|F03|6}} detected MAS boats 532 and 533 approaching the convoy after dark, but was unable to prevent them from torpedoing SS ''Sydney Star'' at around 03:00 on 24 July. The merchant ship, carrying 484 army officers and men in addition to its normal crew, came to a dead stop as it took on water. Fearing that the ship's pumps couldn't cope with the damage, the captain requested evacuation of the troops. The ''Nestor'' came alongside and took on board approximately 500 men via [[gangplank]] and [[Jacob's ladder (nautical)|Jacob's ladder]], leaving the captain and a skeleton crew on the ''Sydney Star.'' The captain later estimated that his ship had taken on 7,000 tons of water.&lt;ref name="ThomasC6"&gt;Thomas, Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nestor'' successfully towed the damaged 11,000-ton cargo ship to Malta,&lt;ref name=g&amp;m/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, David (2002). ''The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean: November 1940-December1941, Volume II''. Routledge, pp. 147–148. {{ISBN|0-7146-5205-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; arriving at the [[Grand Harbour]] shortly after 08:00.&lt;ref name="ThomasC6"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Seven empty ships sailed from Malta as convoy MG 1 on 23 July to be convoyed back to Gibraltar by Force H.&lt;ref name=hag/&gt; One was damaged by an aircraft torpedo on the voyage west. ''Ark Royal'' lost a total of six Fulmars defending convoy MG 1 and the Malta bound ships from Gibraltar&lt;ref&gt;Cull &amp; Galea, P.122: "On 21 July, another convoy (a troopship and six freighters) set sail from Gibraltar, accompanied by Ark Royal, four cruisers and a strong escort of destroyers. As the convoy approached the island, empty vessels at Malta waiting to return westwards were to sail under the protection of the warships. Thus, during the ensuing few days, Italian attention was concentrated on the movements at sea, during which six of ''Ark Royal'' 's Fulmars were lost in return for shooting down six SM79s and a Z506B."&lt;/ref&gt; and at least 12 [[Axis powers|Axis]] aircraft, in total, were destroyed by FAA fighters and the AA guns of the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Naval Staff History, ''The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean Convoys'', p15-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The six cargo ships of convoy GM 1 arrived in Malta on 24 July where they were observed by a [[CANT Z.506]] reconnaissance seaplane escorted by 42 [[Macchi C.200]] fighters. Malta launched 22 [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters which shot down three of the escort without loss. An audacious attack on Grand Harbour by other MAS boats and [[manned torpedo]]es on the night of 25–26 July was thwarted by [[Ultra]] intelligence.&lt;ref name=g&amp;m/&gt;
