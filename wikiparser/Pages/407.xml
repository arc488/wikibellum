The '''Budapest Offensive''' was the general attack by [[Red Army|Soviet]] and [[Romanian Land Forces|Romanian]] armies against Nazi Germany and their [[Axis powers|Axis]] allies from [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]]. The offensive lasted from 29 October 1944 until [[Battle of Budapest|the fall of Budapest]] on 13 February 1945. This was one of the most difficult and complicated offensives that the Soviet Army carried on in [[Central Europe]]. It resulted in a decisive victory for the USSR, as it disabled the last European political ally of Nazi Germany and greatly sped up the ending of World War II in Europe.&lt;ref name="militera.lib.ru"&gt;[http://militera.lib.ru/h/samsonov2/18.html Самсонов, Александр Михайлович Крах фашистской агрессии 1939-1945. — М.: Наука, 1980.] {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
Having secured [[Romania]] in the summer [[Iasi–Kishinev Offensive]], the Soviet forces continued their push in the [[Balkans]]. The Red Army occupied [[Bucharest]] on 31 August, then swept westward across the [[Carpathian Mountains]] into [[Hungary]] and southward into [[Bulgaria]], with parts joining the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] in the [[Belgrade Offensive]]. In the process, the Red Army’s forces drew German reserves away from the [[Warsaw]]-[[Berlin]] central axis, encircled and destroyed the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 6. ''Armee'']] (for the second time) and forced [[Army Group South Ukraine]]’s shattered [[8th Army (Wehrmacht)|8. ''Armee'']] to withdraw west into Hungary.

==The offensive==
From October 1944, the [[2nd Ukrainian Front|2nd]], [[3rd Ukrainian Front|3rd]], and [[4th Ukrainian Front]]s advanced into Hungary. After isolating the Hungarian capital city in late December, the Soviets [[Siege of Budapest|besieged and assaulted Budapest]]. On 13 February 1945, the city fell.

According to the historical documents, the Budapest Offensive can be divided into five periods:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warmech.ru/easteur_0/hun010.html Минасян, М. M. Освобождение Юго-Восточной и Центральной Европы войсками 2-го и 3-го Украинских фронтов 1944-1945. Издательство "Наука", Москва, 1970.] {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''First''' (29 October 1944 - 3 November 1944) and '''Second Periods''' (7 November 1944 – 24 November 1944) were marked by the two large offensives of the 2nd Ukrainian Front, led by Rodion Malinovsky. The battles in these two periods were exceptionally bloody and fierce, since the Germans offered strong resistance against the Soviet onslaught. Though the Red Army managed to gain considerable territory, they failed to capture Budapest, due to the fierce German resistance and their own lack of offensive strength.
* In the '''Third Period''' (3 December 1944 – 26 December 1944), the 3rd Ukrainian Front of [[Fyodor Tolbukhin]] reached the Danube river after [[Belgrade Offensive|liberating Belgrade]], and thus greatly enhanced Soviet offensive power in Hungary. Now with adequate forces, the Soviet fronts launched a two-pronged attack north and south of Budapest, finally encircling the city and trapping about 79,000 German and Hungarian troops inside the Budapest pocket.{{sfn|Frieser|Schmider|Schönherr|Schreiber|2007|p=897}}
* The '''Fourth Period''' (1 January 1945 – 26 January 1945) was marked by a series of strong counter-offensives launched by German reinforcements in an attempt to relieve the siege of Budapest. Some German units managed to penetrate deep into the outskirts of the city, with the most successful ones only 25&amp;nbsp;km away from the Hungarian capital. However, the Soviets managed to withstand all the German attacks and maintain their encirclement.
* Finally, in the '''Fifth Period''' (27 January 1945 – 13 February 1945), the Soviets mustered their forces to eliminate the besieged defenders in the city. The German troops fought for about half a month more before surrendering on 13 February 1945, ending four months of bloody fighting in the Budapest area. Out of the estimated 79,000 defenders less than 1,000 managed to avoid death or captivity.

After the Budapest offensive, the main forces of [[Army Group South]] virtually collapsed. The road to [[Vienna]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and the southern border of [[Germany]] was widely open for the Soviets and their allies.&lt;ref name="militera.lib.ru"/&gt;

According to Soviet claims, the Germans and Hungarians in Budapest lost 49,000 dead soldiers, with 110,000 captured and 269 tanks destroyed.&lt;ref name=9May&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://9may.ru/15.02.1945/inform/m4170 |title=Наша Победа.

==Aftermath==
As most of the German forces in the region were destroyed, troops were rushed in from the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] and, in March, the Germans launched the ill-fated [[Operation Spring Awakening]] (''Unternehmen Frühlingserwachen'') in the Lake Balaton area. The expansive goals of this operation were to protect one of the last oil producing regions available to the Axis and to retake Budapest. Neither goal was achieved.
