The '''Battle of Hill 609''' took place at [[Djebel Tahent]] in northwestern [[Tunisia]] during the [[Tunisia Campaign]]. The battle was for control over the key strategic height Hill 609 and its surrounding area between the American forces of the [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]] and German units of the [[Afrika Korps]].&lt;ref name="Howe33"/&gt; The battle proved a formative experience for the American forces - in their first clear-cut victory of the campaign, and has been called "the American Army's coming-of-age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/01/books/the-wars-in-north-africa.html |title=The Wars in North Africa |first=Russell F. |last=Weigley |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 1, 2002 |accessdate=August 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nathan S|first1=Lowrey|title=The Chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 1949-2016|date=2016|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=9780160933219|page=[https://archive.org/details/chairmanshipofjo00wash/page/147 147]|url=https://archive.org/details/chairmanshipofjo00wash/page/147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
In late April 1943, Hill 609 was the key to the German defensive line facing the [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]], commanded by [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Omar Bradley]]. The German general, [[Hans-Jürgen von Arnim]], used the hill for artillery fire and observation. From the hill, the Germans could also prevent movement by both the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]], commanded by Major General [[Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr.|Terry Allen]], to the south and the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]], commanded by Major General [[Manton S. Eddy|Manton Eddy]], to the north. Hill 609 was deemed one of the most difficult objectives in Tunisia, not only protected by steep slopes and artillery but also by fire from nearby high grounds, which gave the Germans a cross fire on the slopes leading up to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Supreme Commander: The War Years of Dwight D.

Ryder|Charles Ryder]], to take the hill.&lt;ref name="Howe33"/&gt; After heavy fighting and high casualties, the 34th Division managed to take the hill by April 30 and the following day repelled several German [[counterattack]]s.&lt;ref name="Howe33"/&gt;
