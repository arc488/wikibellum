The '''Battle of Pierres Noires''' was a naval action that occurred during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] '''Operation Dredger''', involving several [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) [[destroyer]]s and a German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' [[U-boat]] with escorts near [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[France]].  The RCN force managed to sink or damage some of the escorts on the surface, but the U-boat was able to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TpDlFI453RcC&amp;pg=PA341&amp;lpg=PA341&amp;dq=UJ1420&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bmAqqfxCvQ&amp;sig=DERc-J-3KVSirOJDzNOmoPcUB48&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VYi_TYHUAcK_gQfeyMjWBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=UJ1420&amp;f=false|title=Chronology of the War at Sea, 1939-1945: The Naval History of World War Two|last=Rohwer|first=Jürgen|date=2005|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=|isbn=9781591141198|location=|pages=340|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The port of [[Brest, France|Brest]] had been an important German [[U-boat]] base since the [[Fall of France]], and its capture was one of the objectives of [[Operation Overlord]]. With the increasing effectiveness of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] campaign however it often became essential for any U-boat departing the port to have surface escorts. The German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' would often employ ''[[Vorpostenboot]]''-class [[Naval trawler|escort trawlers]] to accomplish that task, and over time these boats developed a reputation among the Allied navies. On 5 July 1944 Escort Group 12 and Escort Group 14 were deployed to the vicinity of Brest as part of Operation Dredger; EG 12 (Consisting of the RCN [[Canadian River-class destroyer|River-class]] [[destroyer]]s {{HMCS|Saskatchewan|H70|6}}, {{HMCS|Qu'Appelle|H69|6}}, {{HMCS|Skeena|D59|6}} and {{HMCS|Restigouche|H00|6}}) was tasked with intercepting the ships escorting the U-boats, while EG 14 would patrol further offshore to intercept any U-boats that managed to escape.

==Battle==
{{GS|U-741||2}} departed Brest on 5 July 1944 under the protection of 4 ''Vorpostenboot'' escort trawlers. Escort Group 12, with HMCS ''Qu'Appelle'' as the lead boat, detected the German force on [[radar]] and set off in pursuit at 30 knots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=afOEdO8mh1gC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=battle+of+pierres+noires&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0Bk79zNJYK&amp;sig=PbODCdwn7gZP7LQCgk8DQejRJLM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Iqm4Tcq1BIHcgQfvxIzODA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=battle%20of%20pierres%20noires&amp;f=false]  Milner p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; The two sides engaged in the vicinity of the Pierres Noires lighthouse in the late evening. The darkness, combined with uncertainty of the size of the German force and the close range at which the ships engaged each other nullified some of the advantage in speed and armour enjoyed by EG 12, and ''U-741'' managed to escape. However, despite inflicting some damage to all of the Canadian vessels, the ''Vorpostenboot'' ''[[V-715]]'' was sunk, another was heavily damaged, and the remainder withdrew to Brest. EG 12 withdrew to [[Portsmouth]] for repairs.

== Aftermath ==
Operation Dredger would continue with further Allied naval infiltration into the [[Bay of Biscay]], engaging the U-boats and their escorts in their home waters. ''U-741'' was sunk in the [[English Channel]] on 15 August,&lt;ref name="U-741"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/boats/u741.htm|title=U-741|accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few days after American forces began to lay [[Battle for Brest|siege]] to Brest. The last U-boat departed on 4 September, just before the Americans took control of the city on 19 September . HMCS ''Skeena'' would be lost in a storm off [[Iceland]] on 25 October, the only ship from EG 12 not to survive the war.
