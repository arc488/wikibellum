The '''Polotsk Offensive''' ({{lang-ru|Полоцкая наступательная операция}}) was part of the second phase of the Belorussian Strategic Offensive of the [[Red Army]] in summer 1944, commonly known as [[Operation Bagration]].

The Soviet First Baltic Front successfully pursued the retreating remnants of the German Third Panzer Army back towards [[Polotsk]], which was reached by 1 July. German forces attempted to organise a defense using rear-area support units and several divisions hurriedly transferred from Army Group North.

Units of the 1st Baltic Front's 4th Shock Army and 6th Guards Army fought their way into the city over the next few days, and successfully cleared it of German forces by 4 July.

==Planning==

===Operational goals===
The operational goals were two fold:
*To capture the city of [[Polotsk]].
*To protect the northern flank of forces engaged in the parallel [[Minsk Offensive Operation]], preventing a possible counter-attack from the German forces of [[Army Group North]].

==Deployments==

===''Wehrmacht''===
*Remnants of [[3rd Panzer Army|Third Panzer Army]] (Colonel-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]])
**[[IX Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|IX Corps]] (General [[Rolf Wuthmann]])
**Remnants of [[VI Corps (Germany)|VI Corps]]
**Reserve: [[201st Security Division (Germany)|201st Security Division]], [[221st Security Division (Germany)|221st Security Division]]
*Elements of [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|Sixteenth Army]] of [[Army Group North]]

The above units were under the overall command of [[Army Group Centre]] (Field-Marshal [[Walter Model]]).

===Red Army===
*[[1st Baltic Front]] (General [[Hovhannes Bagramyan]])
**[[4th Shock Army (Soviet Union)|4th Shock Army]]
**[[6th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|6th Guards Army]]
**[[43rd Army (Soviet Union)|43rd Army]]
**[[3rd Air Army (Soviet Union)|3rd Air Army]]

==The offensive==
The [[1st Baltic Front]] continued to extend its offensive westwards from June 30, pushing the shattered remnants of [[3rd Panzer Army|Third Panzer Army]]'s [[IX Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|IX Corps]] back towards [[Polotsk]]. Two of the [[6th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|6th Guards Army]]'s rifle corps, the 103rd and 23rd Guards, had advanced some 18&amp;nbsp;km by the end of the day against some German counter-attacks, while the [[4th Shock Army]] had reached the [[Sosnitsa]] River.&lt;ref name=glantzp112&gt;Glantz, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; The Front's tank corps, in the meantime, successfully cut the [[Molodechno]] - [[Polotsk]] rail line, despite advancing a smaller distance than planned due to being held up at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ulla River (Belarus)|ru|3=Улла (река)|lt=Ulla}} crossings.&lt;ref name=glantzp113&gt;Glantz, p.113&lt;/ref&gt;

With the IX Corps having suffered heavy losses, the [[LIII Corps (Germany)|LIII Corps]] effectively wiped out in the [[Vitebsk-Orsha Offensive Operation|encirclement of Vitebsk]] a few days earlier and the [[VI Corps (Germany)|VI Corps]] largely destroyed south and east of [[Vitebsk]], Colonel-General Reinhardt committed his rear-area [[Security Division (Germany)|security divisions]] into the lines. In response to a request from Field-Marshal Model, the [[290th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|290th]] and [[81st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|81st]] Infantry Divisions were hurriedly shifted from [[Army Group North]] to shore up the collapsing defences on the approaches to Polotsk. In the south of the sector, the remnants of IX Corps (the [[252nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|252nd Infantry Division]] and ''[[Korpsabteilung|Korpsabteilung D]]'') and of the former VI Corps (mainly from the [[95th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|95th Infantry Division]]), continued to offer weak resistance, but the Soviet advance, and German retreat, was rapid. A survivor from the 252nd Infantry Division described the experience as "a virtual race westwards, trying to outpace the Soviet units advancing as fast as their logistics would allow them. The Division travelled nearly 500 kilometres".&lt;ref name=scheiderbauerp71&gt;Account of Armin Scheiderbauer in Rogers and Williams, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagramyan's planning envisaged the launch of a final offensive against Polotsk, an important communications and transport centre, on July 1, taking the city by evening.&lt;ref name=glantzp114&gt;Glantz, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was launched that morning by the 4th Shock Army's 100th and 83rd Rifle Corps in co-ordination with elements of the 6th Guards Army. German resistance was strong, and Soviet units were only able to penetrate the town's defences by the next day. On July 2, Soviet forces were involved in fierce fighting to capture the main railway bridge over the [[Daugava river|Dvina]], which formed the main link between the German forces in the north and south of the city; the bridge was eventually taken by the 156th Guards Rifle Regiment. There were intense street battles until the evening of July 4, after which the surviving German forces withdrew.
