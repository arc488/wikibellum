The '''Battle of the Cigno Convoy''' was a naval engagement between two [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] [[O and P-class destroyer|destroyers]] and two Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' [[Spica-class torpedo boat|torpedo boats]] which took place southeast of [[Marettimo]] island, on the early hours of 16 April 1943. The Italian units were escorting the transport ship ''Belluno'', of {{convert|4200|LT|t|abbr=on}}. The convoy also involved the delivery of [[aviation fuel]] to [[Tunisia]] by one of the close escorts, the torpedo boat {{ship|Italian torpedo boat|Tifone||2}}. The British force was fought off by the Italian units, at the cost of one torpedo boat. One of the British destroyers, disabled by Italian gunfire, had to be scuttled after the action.

==Background==
The battle was part of the daily aerial, naval and submarine campaign mounted by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] against [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces, in the spring of 1943, in order to achieve a complete [[Command of the sea|naval]] and [[air supremacy]] around [[North Africa]] and [[Sicily]]. Their aim was to isolate and defeat the bulk of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] ''[[Afrika Corps]]'' and the ''[[Regio Esercito]]'' (Italian Royal Army) in [[Tunis]] by strangling their supply lines. The struggle was so fiercely contested that the maritime area between Italy and Africa was dubbed the "route of death".&lt;ref&gt;Bragadin, page 237&lt;/ref&gt;

By April, Axis merchant ship losses reached an average of 3.3 per day.&lt;ref name= "Sadkovich, page 326"&gt;Sadkovich, page 326&lt;/ref&gt; The huge extension of [[minefield]]s planted by both sides made surface trips against Axis shipping more unlikely than during the Libyan campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Bragadin, page 247&lt;/ref&gt; The supply route for the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Italian Royal Navy) was also shorter but the Allied air supremacy and the attrition of the war made it almost impossible to assemble large convoys. This along with a shortage of fuel, forced the Italians to use small and fast destroyers or torpedo boats to escort their cargo ships heading to Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Bragadin, pp 244–245&lt;/ref&gt; The convoys were only capable of making {{convert|8|–|10|kn|mph km/h|lk=in|abbr=on}} in practice, due to the loss of the main high-speed cargo ships by 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Sadkovich, page 317&lt;/ref&gt;

==The action==

One of these small convoys&amp;nbsp;– comprising two Italian Spica-class [[torpedo boat]]s {{ship|Italian torpedo boat|Cigno|1936|2}} and ''Cassiopea'' escorting the {{convert|4200|LT|t|abbr=on}} transport ''Belluno''&amp;nbsp;– sailed from [[Trapani]] with munitions bound for Tunis on 15 April. A rearguard escorting force composed of the [[Ciclone-class torpedo boat]] ''Tifone'' and the Spica-class ''Climene'' was scheduled to depart a couple of hours later from [[Palermo]] to reinforce the convoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Roberti |first=Vero |title=Con la pelle appesa a un chiodo: la guerra sul mare: 1940–1943 |publisher=U. Mursia |date=1970 |pages=241 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ''Tifone'' had the secondary mission of delivering aviation fuel to [[Bizerte]]. The fuel was pumped right into her fuel bunkers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conlapelleappesaaunchiodo.blogspot.com.ar/search?q=Tifone|title=Tifone|last=Colombo|first=Lorenzo|website=Con la pelle appesa a un chiodo|access-date=2016-11-22|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 02:38 on the 16th, the forward escort spotted two British destroyers approaching – {{HMS|Pakenham|G06|2}} and {{HMS|Paladin|G69|2}}. This was one of the few night engagements in the Mediterranean in which the British failed to take their opponents by surprise, owing to the full moon.&lt;ref name=vince/&gt;&lt;ref name="andó"&gt;{{cite book|last=Andò |first=Elio |last2=Bagnasco |first2=Emilio |title=Navi e marinai italiani nella seconda guerra mondiale |publisher=Albertelli |date=1977 |pages=273 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 2:42 ''Pakenham''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s radar picked up the Italian flotilla at a range of 7,200 yards.&lt;ref name="down" /&gt; Aware of the incoming battle, ''Cigno'' made light signals to ''Tifone'', whose commander ordered the convoy to reverse course. ''Belluno'' turned back to the northeast under the protection of the rear escorting force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conlapelleappesaaunchiodo.blogspot.com.ar/search?q=cigno|title=Cigno|last=Colombo|first=Lorenzo|date=|website=Con la pelle appesa a un chiodo|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2016-11-22|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exchange of fire began at 2:48. The first ship to be hit was ''Cigno'', which was badly damaged but continued firing until sunk at 03:00 by a torpedo launched by ''Paladin,'' with the loss of 103 seamen. ''Pakenham'' had initially engaged ''Cigno'', which was later fired at by ''Paladin'', while ''Pakenham'' turned her attention to ''Cassiopea''.&lt;ref name="down" /&gt;

''Cassiopea'' launched a torpedo at ''Paladin'' while attacking ''Pakenham'' with gunfire. ''Paladin'' successfully evaded the torpedo, but ''Pakenham''{{'}}s port side took six hits.&lt;ref name="down" /&gt; The destroyer's engine room was seriously damaged and flooded,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HMS Pakenham, destroyer|url = http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-48P-Pakenham.htm|website = www.naval-history.net|access-date = 2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; its [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|pom-pom]] and searchlight put out of action, and a fire started in the aft section.&lt;ref name=down/&gt; Several of her crew were scalded by the explosion of a boiler.&lt;ref name=surv/&gt; Nine men were killed, another died of his wounds two days later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-history.net/xDKCas1943-04APR.htm#prof Royal Navy casualties, killed and died, April 1943]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paladin'' was also damaged by shell splinters.&lt;ref name=down&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Arthur S |date=2010 |title=Destroyer Down: An Account of HM Destroyer Losses 1939–1945 |publisher=Pen &amp; Sword Maritime |pages=[https://archive.org/details/destroyerdownacc0000evan/page/157 157] |isbn=1848842708 |url=https://archive.org/details/destroyerdownacc0000evan/page/157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=E fecero tutti il loro dovere: Cause ed effetti |first=Enrico |last=Cernuschi |publisher=Rivista Maritima |date=November 2006 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cassiopea'', almost disabled by return fire and in flames, was assisted by her sister ship ''Climene'', which towed her back to Trapani and later to [[Taranto]] for repairs.&lt;ref name="andó" /&gt;

After trying to reach [[Malta]] with an auxiliary engine, ''Pakenham'' broke down off Sicily and then ''Paladin'', unable to take her in tow, scuttled her [[sister ship]] with a torpedo at 06:30 at the position {{coord|37|26|N|12|30|E}}.
