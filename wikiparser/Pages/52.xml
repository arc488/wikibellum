During the [[World War II|Second World War]], '''Operation Retribution''' was the air and naval blockade designed to prevent the seaborne evacuation of [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] from [[Tunisia]] to Sicily. (The equivalent blockade of air evacuation was [[Operation Flax]].) Axis forces were isolated in northern Tunisia and faced a [[Operation Vulcan|final Allied assault]].

British Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Andrew Cunningham]]—Allied naval commander—began the operation on 7 May 1943, with the colourful signal to "Sink, burn and destroy. Let nothing pass". He had also named the operation "Retribution" in recognition of the losses that his destroyer forces had endured during the [[Greek campaign|German occupations of Greece]] and [[Operation Mercury|Crete]].&lt;ref name=tomblin&gt;{{cite book |last=Tomblin |first=Barbara |date=31 Oct 2004 |title=With utmost spirit: Allied naval operations in the Mediterranean, 1942–1945 |publisher=[[The University Press of Kentucky]] |isbn=0-8131-2338-0 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XDqBUqnrFLYC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=operation+retribution&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yW9KtOf39t&amp;sig=TkQ1kox6D-wC5Uyz-LYwD_Uc-KI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-XSeTNi5G5i8jAfU7ZSsDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=operation%20retribution&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans were unable to mount a significant rescue effort.

The Axis' predicament had been recognised earlier and a large scale effort to evacuate Axis personnel was expected. So, all available naval light forces&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Light forces" included cruisers and all smaller warships. There were 18 destroyers and several flotillas of torpedo boats available.&lt;/ref&gt; were ordered to concentrate at [[Malta]] or [[Annaba|Bone]], with specified patrol areas. In order to achieve this, convoy movements were restricted to release their escorts. The Italian Fleet was expected to intervene, so the [[battleship]]s {{HMS|Nelson|28|6}} and {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} and the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Formidable|67|6}} were moved to [[Algiers]] in readiness for a major action.&lt;ref name=ike&gt;{{cite web |last=Eisenhower |first=Dwight |authorlink=Dwight Eisenhower |title=Report of the Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces ... |pages=47–48 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/rep/TORCH/DDE-Torch.html#retribution |accessdate=26 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event, the Italian Fleet did not leave port and there was no organised attempt to evacuate Axis forces by sea. Two supply ships en route to Tunisia were intercepted and sunk. Inshore flotillas of British [[Motor Torpedo Boat|MTBs]] and American [[PT boat]]s intercepted small craft and raided the waters around Ras Idda and [[Kelibia]].&lt;ref name=tomblin/&gt; The only significant threat to the sea forces were [[friendly fire]] attacks by Allied aircraft, after which red recognition patches were painted on the ships.&lt;ref name=roskill&gt;{{cite web |last=Roskill |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Roskill |title=THE AFRICAN CAMPAIGNS; 1st January - 31st May, 1943 |publisher=[[HyperWar Foundation]] |pages=441–442 |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-RN-II/UK-RN-II-19.html |accessdate=27 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies captured 897 men, 653 Germans and Italians are thought to have escaped to Italy and an unknown number drowned.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Axis forces in north Africa, squeezed into a small area with minimal supplies and facing well-supplied opponents, surrendered on 13 May. The north African ports were rapidly cleared and readied to support the forthcoming invasions of southern Europe. The 12th, 13th and 14th Minesweeping Flotillas from Malta, two groups of minesweeping trawlers and smaller vessels cleared a channel through the minefields of the Sicilian Channel to [[Tripoli]], removing nearly 200 moored [[Naval mine|mines]]. On 15 May, Cunningham signalled that "the passage through the Mediterranean was clear" and that convoys from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Alexandria]] could be started at once. Thus the direct route between Gibraltar and Alexandria—closed since May 1941—was reopened with prodigious savings in shipping and their escorts.&lt;ref name=roskill/&gt;
