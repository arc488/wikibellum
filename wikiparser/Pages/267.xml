The '''Battle of Westerplatte''' was one of the first battles in Germany's [[invasion of Poland]], marking the start of [[World War II]] in [[Europe]]. Beginning on 1 September 1939, [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|army]], [[Kriegsmarine|naval]] and [[Luftwaffe|air forces]] and [[Free City of Danzig Police|Danzig police]] assaulted  [[Poland]]'s Military Transit Depot (''Wojskowa Składnica Tranzytowa'', or ''WST'') on the [[Westerplatte]] peninsula in the harbor of the [[Free City of Danzig]]. The Poles held out for seven days and repelled 13 assaults that included [[dive bomber|dive-bomber]] attacks and naval shelling.

Westerplatte's defense served as an inspiration for the [[Polish Army]] and people in the face of German advances elsewhere, and is still regarded as a symbol of resistance in modern Poland.

==Background==
Westerplatte is a peninsula in the [[Bay of Gdańsk]].&lt;ref name="LerskiLerski1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jerzy Jan Lerski|author2=George J. Lerski|author3=Halina T.

However, the city of Danzig (present-day [[Gdańsk]], Poland), historically an important port city, became an independent [[city-state]], the [[Free City of Danzig]]. The Free City was nominally supervised by the [[League of Nations]] but, over time, Danzig became increasingly allied with Germany, reflecting its predominantly ethnic German population.&lt;ref name="Parish2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Parish|title=Free City in the Balkans: Reconstructing a Divided Society in Bosnia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzQBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210|date=30 October 2009|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85771-273-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|210}}&lt;ref name="Fox2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory H .

In 1921, in the wake of the [[Polish-Soviet War]], the League of Nations granted Poland the right to install a [[garrison]]ed [[ammunition depot]] near Gdańsk.&lt;ref name="JanOsm"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edmund Jan·Osma鈔czyk|author2=Edmund Jan Osmańczyk|author3=Rupert Lee|title=Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements: T to Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSxS2MmQsewC&amp;pg=PA2684|year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-93924-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2684}} Despite  objections from the Free City, this right was confirmed in 1925, and an area of {{convert|60|ha|m2|lk=in}} was selected on the Westerplatte peninsula.&lt;ref name="JanOsm"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://muzeum1939.pl/en/exhibition-westerplatte/845.html|title=Exhibition on Westerplatte|last=Garba|first=Bartłomiej|last2=Westphal|first2=Marcin|date=2017-03-30|website=muzeum1939.pl|publisher=Museum of the Second World War|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Komorowski2009" /&gt;{{rp|443}} Westerplatte was separated from the New Port of the [[Free City of Danzig]] mainly by the [[harbour|harbor]] channel; on land, the Polish-held part of Westerplatte was separated from Danzig's territory by a brick wall topped with barbed wire.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|443}}&lt;ref name="Komorowski2009" /&gt; A dedicated rail line, passing through the Free City, connected the depot with nearby Polish territory.&lt;ref name="Komorowski2009" /&gt;{{rp|443}} The depot, referred to in League documents as the {{ill|Depot for Polish Munitions in Transit in the Port of Danzig|pl|Wojskowa Składnica Tranzytowa}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QIS1wIZmWl0C&amp;q=%22Depot+for+Polish+Munitions+in+Transit+in+the+Port+of+Danzig%22&amp;dq=%22Depot+for+Polish+Munitions+in+Transit+in+the+Port+of+Danzig%22|title=Report to the ...

The Polish garrison's complement was set at 88 soldiers (2 officers, 20 [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]]s, and the rest [[private (rank)|private]]s), and Poland was prohibited construction of further military installations or fortifications on the site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Komorowski2009" /&gt;{{rp|443–444}}

By early 1933, German politicians and media figures complained about the need for border adjustments.  In addition, Polish and French discussed the need for a [[preventive war]] against Germany.  On 6 March 1933, in what became known as the "Westerplatte incident" or "crisis", the Polish government landed a marine battalion on Westerplatte, briefly reinforcing the outpost to about 200 men, demonstrating Polish resolve to defend the outpost; more locally, the Polish maneuver was also intended to put pressure on the Danzig government, which was trying to renounce a prior agreement on shared Danzig-Polish control over the harbor police and to acquire full control of the police and the harbor.&lt;ref name="Weinberg2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crockett|first=Jameson W.|date=2009|title=The Polish Blitz, More than a Mere Footnote to History: Poland and Preventive War with Germany, 1933|journal=Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft|volume=20|issue=4|pages=561–579|doi=10.1080/09592290903455667}}&lt;/ref&gt; The additional Polish troops were withdrawn on 16 March 1933, following protests from the League, Danzig, and Germany, but only in exchange for Danzig's withdrawal of its objections to the harbor-police agreement.&lt;ref name="Weinberg2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5FiQbU_nAkC&amp;pg=PA50|title=Hitler's Foreign Policy 1933–1939: The Road to World War II|author=Gerhard L.

Over subsequent years, the Poles constructed clandestine [[fortification]]s on Westerplatte.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These were not impressive: there were no [[bunker]]s or tunnels, only several small outposts (guardhouses), partially hidden in the peninsula's forest, and several more buildings in the peninsula's center, including [[barracks]]. Most buildings were constructed with [[reinforced concrete]], and were supported by a network of field fortifications ([[trench]]es, [[barricade]]s, and [[barbed wire]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zaloga&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven J.

==Prelude==
In March 1939, a [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|German ultimatum to Lithuania]] led to Germany's annexation of the nearby Lithuanian coastal [[Klaipėda region]]; subsequently, the Westerplatte garrison was placed on alert.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Komorowski2009" /&gt;{{rp|445}} Fearing a possible Nazi ''[[coup d'etat]]'' in Danzig, the Poles decided to secretly reinforce their garrison&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Komorowski2009" /&gt;{{rp|445}} and, for that purpose, resorted to a subterfuge: civilians in Polish Army uniform would leave the base, and new Polish soldiers would enter it.&lt;ref name="Komorowski2009" /&gt;{{rp|445}}

By late August 1939, the Poles had reinforced their 88-man garrison, though its strength is still debated; older sources speak of 182 men, but more recent research suggests something in the range of 210 to 240, including six officers: [[Major]] [[Henryk Sucharski]], [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]] [[Franciszek Dąbrowski]], Captain {{ill|Mieczysław Słaby|pl|Mieczysław Słaby}} [[Poruchik|Lieutenant]] {{ill|Leon Pająk|pl|Leon Pająk}}, Lieutenant {{ill|Stefan Ludwik Grodecki|pl|Stefan Ludwik Grodecki}}, and [[Podporucznik|Second Lieutenant]] {{ill|Zdzisław Kręgielski|pl|Zdzisław Kręgielski}}.&lt;ref name="Komorowski2009" /&gt;{{rp|445}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dróżdż|first=Krzysztof Henryk|date=2013|title=Przyczynek do badań nad stanem liczbowym załogi Wojskowej Składnicy Tranzytowej na Westerplatte we wrześniu 1939 roku|trans-title=Addendum to the studies on the numbers of personnel the Westerplatte Military Depot in September 1939|url=http://bazhum.muzhp.pl/media//files/Przeglad_Historyczno_Wojskowy/Przeglad_Historyczno_Wojskowy-r2013-t14(65)-n2_(244)/Przeglad_Historyczno_Wojskowy-r2013-t14(65)-n2_(244)-s196-200/Przeglad_Historyczno_Wojskowy-r2013-t14(65)-n2_(244)-s196-200.pdf|journal=Przegląd Historyczno-Wojskowy|language=Polish|volume=14(65)/2 (244)|pages=196–200|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jan|first=Szkudliński|date=2012|title=Spór w sprawie białej flagi nad Westerplatte|trans-title=Debate regarding the white flag at Westerplatte|url=http://bazhum.muzhp.pl/media//files/Przeglad_Historyczno_Wojskowy/Przeglad_Historyczno_Wojskowy-r2012-t13_(64)-n4_(242)/Przeglad_Historyczno_Wojskowy-r2012-t13_(64)-n4_(242)-s153-163/Przeglad_Historyczno_Wojskowy-r2012-t13_(64)-n4_(242)-s153-163.pdf|journal=Przegląd Historyczno-Wojskowy|language=Polish|volume=13 (64)/4 (242)|pages=153–163|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates include some 20 mobilized civilians and about 10 regular troops who happened to be on site when fighting began.&lt;ref name="Komorowski2009" /&gt;{{rp|445}} In addition to light arms (pistols, grenades, and about 160 rifles), weaponry included a {{ill|75 mm field gun wz. 1902/26|pl|75 mm armata wz. 1902/26}}, two antitank [[Bofors 37 mm]] guns, four {{ill|81 mm mortars|pl|81 mm moździerz piechoty wz. 31}}, and about 40 machine guns, including 18 heavy ones.&lt;ref name="Komorowski2009" /&gt;{{rp|446}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mhmg.pl/oddzial/13/westerplatte|title=Westerplatte|last=|first=|date=|website=www.mhmg.pl|publisher=Muzeum Historyczne Miasta Gdańska|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141310/http://www.mhmg.pl/oddzial/13/westerplatte|archive-date=2018-06-12|access-date=2018-06-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field fortifications were extended: more trenches were dug, wooden barricades were built, barbed wire was strung into [[wire obstacle]]s, and reinforced concrete shelters were built into the basements of the barracks.

The Polish defense, which anticipated principally a German land-based assault, rested on three lines of defense. The outer line included entrenchments which were to hold long enough for the garrison to mobilize. The second line of defense centered on the six outposts. The final defense comprised the headquarters and barracks at the depot's center.&lt;ref name="Komorowski2009" /&gt;{{rp|445}} The plan called for Westerplatte to hold out for 12 hours, after which the siege was expected to be lifted by Polish reinforcements arriving from the mainland.&lt;ref name=Lask/&gt;

On 25 August 1939 the German [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{SMS|Schleswig-Holstein||2}}, under the pretext of making a [[courtesy call]], sailed into [[Port of Gdańsk|Danzig harbor]],&lt;ref name="Komorowski2009" /&gt;{{rp|446}} anchoring {{convert|164|yd|m}} from Westerplatte. On board was a ''[[Marinestosstruppkompanie]]'' (marine shock-troop company) with orders to launch an attack on Westerplatte on the morning of 26 August 1939. For their planned attack on Westerplatte, the Germans had an ''[[SS Heimwehr Danzig]]'' force of 1,500 men under Police General [[Friedrich-Georg Eberhardt]], and the 225 [[marine (military)|marines]] under [[Lieutenant]] [[Wilhelm Henningsen]]. In overall command was Captain [[Gustav Kleikamp]], aboard the ''Schleswig-Holstein''. On 26 August he moved the battleship farther upstream. Major Sucharski, commanding Westerplatte, put his garrison on heightened alert.&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt;{{rp|12}} Shortly before the German disembarkation, the orders were rescinded. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] had postponed hostilities on learning of the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]], signed the day before, on 25 August 1939, and that Italy was hesitant about its obligations under the [[Pact of Steel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Janusz Piekałkiewicz|authorlink=Janusz Piekałkiewicz|title=Sea War, 1939–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DEogAAAAMAAJ|year=1987|publisher=Historical Times|isbn=978-0-918678-17-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}

On the early morning of 1 September 1939, the ''Schleswig-Holstein'' suddenly fired a broadside salvo at the Polish garrison.

They found themselves in a [[kill zone]] of Polish crossfire from concealed firing positions (they believed they were also fired on by [[sniper]]s in the trees, but that was not so), while [[barbed wire|barbed-wire]] entanglements impeded their movements. The Poles knocked out a German ''[[Schutzpolizei (Nazi Germany)|Schutzpolizei]]'' machine-gun nest, and Lt. Leon Pająk opened intense howitzer fire on the advancing Germans, who faltered and broke off their attack.

At 06:22 the German marines frantically radioed the battleship that they had sustained heavy losses and were withdrawing.

On 4 September, a [[German torpedo boats of World War II|German torpedo boat]], the ''[[T196]]'', supported by an old minesweeper, the ''Von der Gronen'' (formerly {{SMS|M107|1918|2}}), made a surprise attack from the sea side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rohwer|first1=Jürgen| last2= Hümmelchen |first2=Gerhard|title= Chronology of the War at Sea 1939–1945|year=1992|publisher=Greenhill Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-85367-117-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The Poles' ''Wał'' post had been abandoned, and now only the ''Fort'' position prevented an attack from the north.&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt;{{rp|14}} Though the Poles never landed a hit on the German naval units, the ''T196'' and the ''Schleswig-Holstein'' suffered accidents due to crew error or equipment failure, with at least several injured men and at least one fatality on the battleship.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On 5 September Major Sucharski held a conference with his officers, during which he urged surrender: the post had only been supposed to hold out for twelve hours.&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt;{{rp|11,14}} His deputy, Captain [[Franciszek Dąbrowski]], opposed surrender and the group decided to hold out a while longer.&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt;{{rp|14}}

Subsequently, the Poles repelled several cautious German probing attacks by the marines, Danzig ''[[SS]]'' and police, and ''[[Wehrmacht]]''. At 03:00 on 6 September, during one of the attacks, the Germans sent a burning train toward the land bridge, but the ploy failed when the terrified driver decoupled prematurely.&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt;{{rp|14}} The train failed to reach the oil cistern and set fire to the woods, which had provided the Poles with valuable cover. In addition, the flaming wagons created a perfect field of fire, and the Germans suffered heavy losses. A second fire-train attack, in the afternoon, likewise failed.&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt;{{rp|15}}

At a second conference with his officers, on 6 September, Sucharski was again ready to surrender: the German Army was by now outside [[Warsaw]], and Westerplatte was running critically low on supplies; moreover, many of the wounded were suffering from [[gangrene]].&lt;ref name=Mann/&gt;{{rp|15}} At 04:30 on 7 September the Germans opened intense fire on Westerplatte which lasted till 07:00.

At 09:45 on 7 September 1939 a white flag appeared.

On 8 September, the day after the capitulation, the Germans discovered a grave with the bodies of four unidentified Polish soldiers who had been executed by their comrades for attempted [[desertion]].  This had likely taken place following the 2 September air raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sudoł|first=Tomasz|date=2013|title=Tajemnica Westerplatte|url=http://pamiec.pl/download/49/30538/Tajemnica_Westerplatte__22013.pdf|journal=Pamięć.pl|language=Polish|volume=2|pages=14–15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five days after the capitulation, on 12 September 1939, the Polish wireless operator, [[sergeant]] Kazimierz Rasiński, was murdered by the Germans.

Controversy surrounds the Polish garrison's commanding officer, [[Henryk Sucharski|Major Henryk Sucharski]], and his [[executive officer]], Captain [[Franciszek Dąbrowski]]. Early historiography considered Major Sucharski to have been in command throughout the battle, and consequently early accounts   portrayed him as a heroic figure. More recent accounts from the early 1990s have presented evidence that Sucharski's officers had vowed not to disclose in their lifetimes that their commander had been [[shell-shock]]ed for most of the battle and had advocated surrender as early as 2 September, and several times thereafter; and that Captain Dąbrowski had effectively taken command following Sucharski's breakdown on the second day of the siege.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=doct/&gt;{{rp|153}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://histmag.org/major-henryk-sucharski-wojskowy-z-tajemnica-13841/1|title=Major Henryk Sucharski: wojskowy z tajemnicą|last=Kwiatkowski|first=Mikołaj|date=2016-08-30|work=Histmag.org|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Derdej2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=La5KfmIfGv8C&amp;pg=PA8|title=Westerplatte, Oksywie, Hel 1939|author=Piotr Derdej|publisher=Bellona|year=2009|pages=8|language=Polish|id=GGKEY:XBT004NC99S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sucharski's conduct is still debated by historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wyborcza.pl/alehistoria/1,121681,16550762,Tajemnica_majora_Sucharskiego.html|title=Tajemnica majora Sucharskiego|last=Maciorowski|first=Mirosław|date=1 September 2014|work=wyborcza.pl|access-date=2018-07-06|language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For both sides the battle had mostly political, rather than tactical, importance.&lt;ref name="Komorowski2009" /&gt;{{rp|447}} Still, it did tie up substantial German forces for much longer than anyone had expected, notably preventing the ''Schleswig-Holstein'' from lending fire support in the nearby [[battle of Hel|battles of Hel]] and [[battle of Gdynia|Gdynia]].&lt;ref name="Komorowski2009" /&gt;{{rp|448}}

Westerplatte's defense inspired the Polish Army and people even as German advances continued elsewhere; beginning 1 September 1939, [[Polish Radio]] repeatedly broadcast the phrase that made Westerplatte an important symbol: ''"Westerplatte broni się jeszcze"'' ("Westerplatte fights on").&lt;ref name=doct&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sbc.org.pl/Content/96273/doktorat3357.pdf|title=Westerplatte.
