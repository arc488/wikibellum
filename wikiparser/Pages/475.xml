The naval '''Battle of Kula Gulf''' (Japanese: クラ湾夜戦) took place in the early hours of 6 July 1943 during [[World War II]]. The battle involved United States and Japanese ships off the eastern coast of [[Kolombangara]] in the [[Solomon Islands]]. It took place during the early stages of the [[New Georgia campaign]] when a Japanese force landing reinforcements at [[Vila, Solomon Islands|Vila]] was intercepted by a force of US Navy [[cruiser]]s and [[destroyer]]s. One US [[light cruiser]] was sunk during the engagement while two Japanese destroyers were sunk and two more were damaged. The Japanese withdrew after the engagement, having landed 1,600 troops.

==Background==

In mid-1943, in the wake of the [[Guadalcanal campaign]], the Allies launched their next offensive in the Solomon Islands, landing troops on the island of [[Landings on Rendova|Rendova]] on 30 June as a preliminary step to seizing the major Japanese airstrip at [[Munda (Solomon Islands)|Munda]] on New Georgia Island. The US landing on Rendova took place to set up an initial [[beachhead]] from which to move troops across [[Blanche Channel]] to New Georgia. After Rendova had been secured, the move to Zanana on the mainland took place on 2 July, after which US forces began the westward [[Drive on Munda Point|advance on Munda]]. In order to support this effort, and cut off Japanese reinforcements from moving down the Munda trail from [[Bairoko Harbor|Bairoko]], the Allies decided to land a force on the north shore of New Georgia on 5 July. Meanwhile, the Japanese sought to reinforce the Munda area, moving troops and supplies via barge from the [[Shortland Islands|Shortlands]], via [[Kolombangara]].&lt;ref&gt;Stille, ''The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville'', pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NewGeorgiaGroup5.jpg|The New Georgia group of islands. The Kula Gulf lies between Kolombangara and northwestern New Georgia|thumb|left|350px]]

The night before the battle in the Kula Gulf, [[Rear Admiral]] [[Walden L. Ainsworth]]'s [[United States Navy]] [[Task Group]] 36.1 (TG&amp;nbsp;36.1) conducted a cruiser bombardment of [[Vila, Solomon Islands|Vila]] on Kolombangara Island and Bairoko. This operation was undertaken to support a [[Battle of Enogai|landing at Rice Anchorage]] on the northern shore of New Georgia, by [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] and United States Army troops tasked with capturing Enogai and Bairoko.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 153–161&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the same time as the Marines were landing at Rice Anchorage two US Navy destroyers, [[USS Strong (DD-467)|USS ''Strong'']] and [[USS Chevalier (DD-451)|''Chevalier'']], entered Bairoko Harbor to provide naval gunfire support. In the early hours of the morning a torpedo was spotted closing which hit ''Strong'' on her port side aft, resulting in the loss of the destroyer. A total of 241 survivors were rescued by ''Chevalier'' while ''O'Bannon'' attempted to return fire;&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 156–158&lt;/ref&gt; 46 US sailors lost their lives during the attack.&lt;ref name=Nevitt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/niizuk_o.htm |year=1996 |author=Nevitt, Allyn D. |title=Introduction: The Niizuki  |website=The Long Lancers |publisher=Combined fleet.com |accessdate=17 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fatal [[Type 93 torpedo]] was a ''Long Lance''. It came from a salvo of 14 torpedoes fired by a group of four Japanese destroyers, led by {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Niizuki||2}}. The torpedo traveled a distance of {{convert|11|nmi|km}}&lt;ref name=Nevitt/&gt; and is believed to be longest successful torpedo attack of the war. After firing their torpedoes the Japanese destroyers departed the area without being detected. Such was the distance of the shot, the US commander believed that his force had been attacked by a Japanese submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Stille, ''The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville'', p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
Ainsworth's task group consisted of the [[light cruiser]]s {{USS|Honolulu|CL-48}}, {{USS|St. Louis|CL-49}}, and {{USS|Helena|CL-50}}, plus four [[destroyer]]s, ''[[USS Nicholas (DD-449)|Nicholas]]'', ''[[USS O'Bannon (DD-450)|O'Bannon]]'', ''[[USS Radford (DD-446)|Radford]]'' and ''[[USS Jenkins (DD-447)|Jenkins]]''. On the afternoon of 5 July, they were returning to the [[Coral Sea]] to resupply, when Admiral [[William Halsey]] was informed of another "[[Tokyo Express]]" mission down "[[the Slot]]" in the [[Solomon Islands]], from [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]], on Bougainville.&lt;ref&gt;Stille, ''The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville'', p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 160–161&lt;/ref&gt; Ordered to intercept the Japanese, Ainsworth changed course, and proceeded northwest past [[New Georgia]] Island. ''Chevalier'' had been damaged picking up survivors from ''Strong'', and left the area; they were replaced by ''Radford'' and ''Jenkins'', who left Tulagi at 16:47 hours and 18:37 hours on 5 July respectively, after replenishing.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Japanese destroyer Nagatsuki abandoned 1944.jpg|thumb|left|''Nagatsuki'' abandoned, May 1944]]

The American ships passed Visu Visu Point, on the northwest coast of New Georgia, just after midnight on 6 July. About an hour later, Ainsworth's task force was off the east coast of Kolombangara, about half a mile from Visu Visu Point, and roughly northeast of Waugh Rock,&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 162, 164–165 (map)&lt;/ref&gt; when they came into contact with a Japanese naval reinforcement group consisting of two transport units carrying troops, escorted by a support unit, under Admiral [[Teruo Akiyama]]. The Japanese force consisted of ten ships in total, all of which were destroyers. The support unit was made up of three ships from the 3rd Destroyer Squadron, while the first transport unit (designated the 30th Transport Division) was made up of three destroyers, and the second transport unit (designated the 11th Transport Division) consisted of four destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, ''The U.S. Navy Against the Axis: Surface Combat, 1941–1945'', Table 8.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morison162&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Japanese ships were carrying 2,600 ground troops and were bound for Vila, which was being used as a staging point for moving reinforcements to Munda. When the battle began, Akiyama's force was divided into two parts: the three escorts of the support unit (''Niizuki'', ''[[Japanese destroyer Suzukaze|Suzukaze]]'' and ''[[Japanese destroyer Tanikaze (1940)|Tanikaze]]'') trailing the main column consisting of the four ships from the second transport unit (''[[Japanese destroyer Amagiri (1930)|Amagiri]]'', ''[[Japanese destroyer Hatsuyuki (1928)|Hatsuyuki]]'', ''[[Japanese destroyer Nagatsuki (1926)|Nagatsuki]]'' and ''[[Japanese destroyer Satsuki (1925)|Satsuki]]'').&lt;ref name=Love144&gt;Love, ''History of the U.S. Navy: 1942–1991'', p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stille, ''The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the three ships of the first transport unit, ''[[Japanese destroyer Mochizuki (1927)|Mochizuki]]'', ''[[Japanese destroyer Mikazuki (1926)|Mikazuki]]'' and ''[[Japanese destroyer Hamakaze (1940)|Hamakaze]]'', were unloading at Vila, about {{convert|8.5|mi}} away.&lt;ref&gt;Stille, ''The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville'', p. 46 (map)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morison162/&gt;

The escorts of the Japanese support unit were the first to be engaged. The U.S. ships, having tracked their opponents with radar, opened fire at 01:57 hours, firing 612 shells in 21 minutes and six seconds, quickly sinking the destroyer ''Niizuki'' and killing Admiral Akiyama.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, ''Cartwheel: The Reduction of Rabaul'', p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prados, ''Combined Fleet Decoded'', p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Helena'' had expended all of her flashless powder the previous night, and she was forced to use smokeless powder, thus illuminating herself to the Japanese ships with every [[salvo]]. Two of the Japanese destroyers launched their Long Lance [[torpedo]]es and hit ''Helena'', fatally damaging her.&lt;ref name=Love144/&gt; After heading away from Vila following first contact, the main Japanese force broke away behind a smokescreen.&lt;ref name=Love144/&gt; In the process, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Nagatsuki|1926|2}} was hit by a single 6-inch shell, and ran aground near Bambari Harbor, on Kolombangara, {{convert|5|mi}} north of Vila, while {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Hatsuyuki|1928|2}} was damaged slightly by two shells, which failed to explode.&lt;ref name=Stille48/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morison172/&gt; 

Around 03:30 hours, Ainsworth began retiring towards Tulagi, while the Japanese headed for Buin. Two American destroyers, ''Radford'' and ''O'Bannon'', remained behind to rescue survivors, as did the Japanese destroyer, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Amagiri|1930|2}}. At about 05:00, ''Amagiri'' and ''Nicholas'' exchanged torpedoes and gunfire;&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; hit four times, ''Amagiri'' withdrew. The beached ''Nagatsuki'' was abandoned by her crew in the morning, and was later bombed and destroyed by American aircraft.&lt;ref name=Stille48&gt;Stille, ''The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mikazuki'' and ''Hamakaze'' completed unloading, and departed through the Blackett Strait, while ''Mochizuki'' lingered for another hour before leaving through the Kula Gulf along the coast of Kolombangara, clashing briefly with ''Nicholas'', around 06:15 before withdrawing behind a smoke screen.&lt;ref name=Morison174/&gt;

==Aftermath==

US losses during the battle amounted to one light cruiser sunk and 168 killed, all of whom were from ''Helena'',&lt;ref name=Morison194/&gt; while the Japanese lost two destroyers sunk and two destroyers damaged, with 324 men killed. The breakdown of casualties for the Japanese by ship was as follows: ''Niizuki'' (300 killed), ''Amagiri'' (10 killed), ''Nagatsuki'' (eight killed and 13 wounded), and ''Hatsuyuki'' (six killed).&lt;ref name=losses/&gt;&lt;ref name=Morison174/&gt; The Japanese succeeded in landing 1,600 troops at Vila, as well as 90 tons of supplies.&lt;ref name=Stille48/&gt; For his actions leading the column of cruisers at Kula Gulf and earlier in the campaign, Captain [[Robert W. Hayler]] of the ''Honolulu'' received his second [[Navy Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010821093838/http://www.spear.navy.mil/ships/dd997/dd997_admhay.html |url=http://www.spear.navy.mil/ships/dd997/dd997_admhay.html |title=Vice Admiral Robert W. Hayter |publisher=United States Navy |accessdate=17 June 2020 |archivedate=21 August 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destroyers ''Radford'' and ''Nicholas'' returned to rescue survivors from ''Helena''. While rescuing over 750 men, ''Radford'' and ''Nicholas'' had to reengage the Japanese three times; they were awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] for their rescue. ''Amagiri'' escaped and later rammed and cut in half the [[PT boat|motor torpedo boat]] [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|USS ''PT-109'']], captained by future [[President of the United States]] [[John F. Kennedy]] (1917–1963), in the Blackett Strait, southwest of Kolombangara on 2 August.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hatsuyuki'' and ''Satsuki'' returned to Buin via the Blackett Strait.&lt;ref name=Morison172&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the engagement in the Kula Gulf, the Japanese continued to move reinforcements south to New Georgia. On 9 July, 1,200 troops were moved to Kolombangara successfully without opposition. Another effort on 12/13 July, however, resulted in the [[Battle of Kolombangara]].&lt;ref&gt;Stille, ''The Solomons 1943–44: The Struggle for New Georgia and Bougainville'', pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, ashore, US troops had secured Enogai on the northwestern coast on 10–11 July, while around Munda the Japanese stubbornly resisted US efforts to advance towards the airfield, which stalled and was eventually halted by a [[New Georgia counterattack|Japanese counterattack]] on 17 July.&lt;ref&gt;Rottman, ''Japanese Army in World War II'', pp. 66–68&lt;/ref&gt;
