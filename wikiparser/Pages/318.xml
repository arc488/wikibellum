{{Campaignbox Rzhev}} {{Campaignbox Axis-Soviet War}}

The '''Battles of Rzhev''' ({{lang-ru|Ржевская битва}}) were a series of Soviet operations in [[World War II]] between January 8, 1942 and March 31, 1943.  Due to the high losses suffered by the Soviet Army, the campaign became known by veterans and historians as the "'''Rzhev Meat Grinder'''" ("Ржевская мясорубка").

The operations took place in the general area of [[Rzhev]], [[Sychyovka, Sychyovsky District, Smolensk Oblast|Sychyovka]] (later known as Sychevka) in [[Sychyovsky District]], and [[Vyazma]] against [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces.

==Overview==
The major operations that were executed in this area of the front were:
#Rzhev–Vyazma Strategic Offensive Operation '''(8 January – 20 April 1942)''' ({{lang-ru|Ржевско-Вяземская стратегическая наступательная операция}}) of the [[Kalinin Front]], [[Soviet Western Front|Western Front]], [[Bryansk Front]], and [[Northwestern Front]]

# [[First Rzhev–Sychyovka Offensive Operation]]  '''(30 July – 23 August 1942)''', (other sources say ending on 30 September or 1 October 1942) ({{lang-ru|Первая Ржевско-Сычёвская (Гжатская) наступательная операция}})by forces of the Kalinin Front and Western Front

These operations occurred during the planned German retreat from the salient known as [[Operation Büffel]]

==Rzhev-Vyazma Strategic Offensive Operation==
[[File:Bt7 6.jpg|thumb|right|A Soviet [[BT-7]] light tank carrying men forward]]
During the [[Eastern Front (WWII)#Soviet counter-offensive: Winter 1941|Soviet winter counter-offensive of 1941]], and the [[Rzhev-Vyazma Strategic Offensive Operation]] (8 January 1942 – 20 April 1942), German forces were pushed back from [[Moscow]]. As a result, a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] was formed along the front line in the direction of the capital, which became known as the Rzhev-Vyazma Salient. It was strategically important for the German [[Army Group Centre]] due to the threat it posed to Moscow, and was therefore heavily fortified and strongly defended.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-269-0219-24, Russland, Soldaten auf nasser Strasse.jpg|thumb|right|German soldiers march through the mud, March 1942]]
Initial Soviet forces committed by the [[Kalinin Front|Kalinin]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] included the [[22nd Army (Soviet Union)|22nd]], [[29th Army (Soviet Union)|29th]], [[30th Army (Soviet Union)|30th]], [[31st Army (Soviet Union)|31st]], [[39th Army (Soviet Union)|39th]] of the former, and the [[1st Shock Army|1st Shock]], [[5th Army (Soviet Union)|5th]], [[10th Army (Soviet Union)|10th]], [[16th Army (Soviet Union)|16th]], [[20th Army (Soviet Union)|20th]], [[33rd Army (Soviet Union)|33rd]], [[43rd Army (Soviet Union)|43rd]], [[49th Army (Soviet Union)|49th]], and [[50th Army (Soviet Union)|50th]] armies and three cavalry corps for the latter. The intent was for the [[22nd Army (Soviet Union)|22nd Army]], [[29th Army (Soviet Union)|29th Army]] and 39th Armies supported by the 11th Cavalry Corps to attack West of Rzhev, and penetrate deep into the western flank of Army Group Centre's 9th Army. This was achieved in January, and by the end of the month the cavalry corps found itself 110&amp;nbsp;km in the depth of the German flank. To eliminate this threat to the rear of the Army Group Centre's [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]], the Germans had started Operation Seydlitz by 2 July. However, due to the nature of the terrain the supply route of the troops of the Soviet [[22nd Army (Soviet Union)|22nd Army]], [[29th Army (Soviet Union)|29th Army]] and 39th Armies which attempted to enlarge the penetration became difficult, and they were encircled. The cutting of a major highway to Rzhev by the cavalry signalled the commencement of the [[Toropets–Kholm Offensive]].

==Operation Seydlitz==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-269-0240-11A, Russland, Panzer mit aufgesesssener Infanterie.jpg|thumb|right|Panzer III carrying infantry in March, 1942]]
In the aftermath of the Soviet winter counteroffensive of 1941–42, substantial Soviet forces remained in the rear of the German Ninth Army. These forces maintained a hold on the primitive forested swamp region between Rzhev and Bely. On July 2, 1942, Ninth Army under General Model launched Operation Seydlitz to clear the Soviet forces out. The Germans first blocked the natural breakout route through the Obsha valley and then split the Soviet forces into two isolated pockets. The battle lasted eleven days and ended with the elimination of the encircled Soviet forces.

==Second Rzhev-Sychyovka Strategic Offensive (Operation Mars)==
{{Main|Operation Mars}}

The next Rzhev-Sychyovka Offensive (25 November 1942 – 20 December 1942) codenamed [[Operation Mars]].
The operation consisted of several incremental offensive phases:
:[[Sychevka Offensive]] 24 November 1942 – 14 December 1942
:[[Belyi Offensive]] 25 November 1942 – 16 December 1942
:[[Luchesa Offensive]] 25 November 1942 – 11 December 1942
:[[Molodoi Tud Offensive]] 25 November 1942 – 23 December 1942
:[[Battle for Velikiye Luki|Velikiye Luki Offensive]] 24 November 1942 – 20 January 1943

This operation was nearly as heavy in losses for the Red Army as the first offensive, and also failed to reach desired objectives, but the Red Army tied down German forces which may have otherwise been used to try to relieve the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|Stalingrad garrison]]. An [[NKVD]] double agent known as Heine provided information about the offensive to the [[OKH]] as part of the plan to divert German forces from any relief of those trapped at Stalingrad.&lt;ref&gt;Tennant H. Bayley, ''Spy Wars: Moles, Mysteries and Deadly Games'', 2007, Yale University Press, p. 117. Bayley cites Pavel Sudoplatov, Anatoly Sudoplatov, and Jerrold and Leona Schecter's book ''Special Tasks'', published by Little, Brown in 1994, p. 158–159. He also quotes a KGB chief as writing, "[[Georgy Zhukov|Marshal Zhukov]] knew his offensive was an auxiliary operation, but he did not know that he had been targeted in advance by the Germans."&lt;/ref&gt;

German forces in the salient were eventually withdrawn by Hitler during [[Operation Büffel]] to provide greater force for the [[Battle of Kursk|German offensive operation]] at [[Kursk]].

Fighting in the area remained mostly static for 14 months. Losses and setbacks elsewhere along the front finally compelled the Germans to abandon the salient in order to free up reserves for the front as a whole.

Defending the salient required 29 divisions. Its abandonment freed up 22 of those divisions and created a strategic reserve which allowed the Germans to stabilize the front and somewhat recover from massive losses at Stalingrad.

German general [[Heinz Guderian]] had doubts about the strategic aims of the later [[Operation Citadel]], since the Germans had to abandon the strategically important Rzhev-Vyazma salient for gathering troops to attempt to take a much less valuable one at Kursk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://militera.lib.ru/memo/german/guderian/09.html Гудериан Гейнц.

The Soviet Army paid a high price for their defeat at Rzhev, but the Germans were forced to withdraw from an important bridgehead which enabled the Germans to threaten Moscow. The Germans, however retreated to defensive positions that were as strong as the ones they held within the salients, contributing to the failure of Red Army offensives against Army Group Center in the summer of 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/samsonov2/11.html|title=ВОЕННАЯ ЛИТЕРАТУРА --[ Военная история ]-- Самсонов А.М.

===Military losses===
Losses for the entire series of operations around the Rzhev salient from 1941 to 1943 are difficult to calculate. These operations cover an entire series of battles and defensive operations over a wide area involving many formations on both sides.

For the whole series of Rzhev battles, the numbers are not clear yet. But, since the mobilized manpower of both sides were enormous and the fighting is violent, casualties should be very high. According to A. V. Isayev, the Soviet losses from January 1942 to March 1943 is 392,554 irrecoverable and 768,233 sanitary.&lt;ref name="actualhistory.ru"/&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2020 |reason= Clarify distinction between "irrecoverable" and "sanitary" casualities.}} The Soviet losses during the beginning period of 1942 (including "operation Jupiter") are 272,320 irrecoverable and 504,569 sanitary; with 25.7% of total manpower participated in these battles killed in the battlefield.&lt;ref name="rus-sky.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rus-sky.com/history/library/w/w06.htm#_Toc536603371|title=РОССИЯ И СССР В ВОЙНАХ XX ВЕКА.

Russian historian Svetlana Gerasimova, states that the official Soviet casualties of 1,324,823 men for the four offensive operations against the Rzhev-Viaz’ma salient only accounts to approximately eight out of the 15 months (between the start and endpoint of the operations) of fighting.{{sfn|Gerasimova|2016|p=157}} Soviet operational losses from May–July and October–November 1942, and January–February 1943 are missing and not included in the official figure.{{sfn|Gerasimova|2016|p=158}} Gerasimova states that with the inclusion of casualties from these seven months, and the official casualty figures of the four offensive operations, the total losses approach 2,300,000 men.{{sfn|Gerasimova|2016|pp=158-159}}

Retired German general [[Horst Grossmann]] did not provide the total casualties of the German side in his book ''Rzhev, the basement of the Eastern Front''. But according to his description, from 31 July to 9 August, one German battalion at the front line, after being exhausted in the violent battles, only had one commandant and 22 soldiers, and by 31 August there were battalions which had only one commandant and 12 soldiers (equal to one [[squad]]). According to Grossmann, during [[Operation Mars]], the Germans suffered 40,000 casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/grossman/index.html|title=ВОЕННАЯ ЛИТЕРАТУРА --[ Военная история ]-- Гроссманн Х.

According to the German reports which are still stored at the Storage Center of National Documents of [[Germany]], from March 1942 to March 1943, the casualties of the 2nd, 4th, 9th, 2nd Panzer, 3rd Panzer and 4th Panzer Army (The 4th Panzer Army only have data from March to Aprilref name="ww2stats.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ww2stats.com/cas_ger_okh_dec42.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151228032412/http://ww2stats.com/cas_ger_okh_dec42.html |archivedate=2015-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ww2stats.com/cas_ger_okh_dec43.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525020822/http://ww2stats.com/cas_ger_okh_dec43.html |archivedate=2013-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Mikhail Yuryevich Myagkov]], the casualties of German forces from January 1942 to March 1943 are about 330,000 irrecoverable and more than 450,000 sanitary.&lt;ref name="militera.lib.ru"&gt;[http://militera.lib.ru/research/myagkov/02.html]  Мягков Михаил Юрьевич "Вермахт у ворот Москвы, 1941–1942" — Глава II.

===Civilian losses===
[[File:RIAN archive 982 Ruins of a house.jpg|thumb|left|Local family in front of their ruined house.]]

Before the war, Rzhev had more than 56,000 people, but when it was liberated on 3 March 1943, there were only 150 people remaining, plus 200 in the surrounding rural area. The inhabitants were transported to Germany and Eastern Europe{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Out of 5,443 houses, only 297 remained. Material losses were estimated at 500 million rubles (1941 value).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rshew-42.narod.ru/rshew_history.html|title=История Ржевской битвы 1941-1943 гг.|first=Mole|last=Man|date=|website=rshew-42.narod.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vyazma was also virtually destroyed during the war. In this city, two transit camps of Nazi Germany, named Dulag No. 184 and Dulag No. 230 were established. Prisoners in these camps were Soviet soldiers and Soviet civilians from the area of [[Smolensk]], [[Nelidovo]], Rzhev, [[Zubtsov]], [[Gzhatsk]], and [[Sychyovka, Sychyovsky District, Smolensk Oblast|Sychyovka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dulag184.vyazma.info/|title=Дулаг 184 - Лагерь военнопленных|author=|date=|website=dulag184.vyazma.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to German data collected by the Soviet counter-espionage agency [[SMERSH]], 5,500 people died of their wounds. During the winter of 1941-42, in these camps, about 300 people each day were killed by diseases, cold, starvation, torture and other causes. After the war, two mass graves were discovered in the area, each a size of 4 × 100 m and in total containing an estimated 70,000  bodies, all of them unidentified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stapravda.ru/20090619/poisk_rodstvennikov_soldat_pogibshikh_vo_vkremya_vov_38220.html|title=Поиск родственников солдат, погибших во время ВОВ|author=|date=|website=stapravda.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germans also discovered and executed 8 local political leaders, 60 [[commissar]]s and [[politruk|political instructor]]s, and 117 [[Jew]]s at the Dulag No. 230 camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewniverse.ru/RED/Shneyer/glava2os_v%5B2%5D.htm#_ftnref23|title=Арон Шнеер.

==Strengths and weaknesses in the Soviet and German tactics==

===USSR===

====Strength====
The Soviets managed to exploit the earlier victory at the [[Battle of Moscow]] and create some advantages in the critical sector of the front. Their attacks threatened the flanks of [[Army Group Center]] and forced the Germans to divert the forces to these areas, therefore reducing the pressure on Moscow. During this time, the USSR's Army commanders began to concentrate their main forces at the critical zones to strengthen their position in these areas, or to muster enough power for their assaults. In addition, the Soviets also started using tanks as a main assault force instead of a mere supporting tool for infantry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://militera.lib.ru/h/isaev_av6/04.html Исаев, Алексей Валерьевич.

Yauza &amp; Penguin Books. Moskva. 2006. Part I: 1942 Summer-Autumn Offensive. Section 1: the first summer attacks)] {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Front commanders also got some important experience in commanding and coordinating a combined force. From May 1942, Soviet Fronts started to deploy their own air armies for supporting the land troops, reporting under the direct command of the Front commanders. Thus these commanders began to have some sort of full authority to use the air forces, except the long-ranged strategic bomber units which were still under direct command of the Soviet Stavka.&lt;ref&gt;[http://militera.lib.ru/h/kozhevnikov_mn/03.html Кожевников, Михаил Николаевич.

The Soviet Air Force Command and Staff in the Great Patriotic War (1941-1945). Science Publisher. Moskva. 1977. Chapter III, Section 2)] {{in lang|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the "manpower crisis" of late 1941, in 1942 the Soviets had gathered enough strategic reserves, and they also began to pay more attention to developing them. In 1942 the Soviets managed to build 18 new reserve armies and resupply 9 others. At Rzhev, the army received 3 reserve armies and had 3 others resupplied. Of course, in this period, many Soviet units still had inadequate strength and equipment, but with the more plentiful reserve force, they managed to somewhat maintain stable fighting capability and prevent the severe fluctuation in manpower. This enabled the Red Army to conduct active defenses and prepare for large-scaled offensives.&lt;ref name="K. Zhukov p 2"&gt;G. K. Zhukov. Memoirs. Vol 2. Quân đội nhân dân Publisher.

As the second top person of the Stavka, G. K. Zhukov was one of the first Soviet military officers to admit and to make a strict self-criticism about the Soviet's and also his own faults in this period:

{{quote|Today, after reflecting the events of 1942, I see that I had many shortcomings in evaluating the situation at Vyazma. We overestimated ourselves and underestimated the enemies. The "walnut" there was much stronger that what we predicted.|G. K. Zhukov.&lt;ref name="K. Zhukov p 2"/&gt;|}}

The Soviet Army suffered terribly from severe deficits in weapons and equipment due to the tremendous losses during [[operation Barbarossa|the German onslaught in 1941]]. Meanwhile, during the first half of 1942, the reserved source of equipment was still not adequate. For example, during January and February 1942, the Western Front only received 55% of needed 82mm mortar rounds, 36% of needed 120mm rounds and 44% of needed artillery munitions. On average, each artillery battery only had 2 rounds per day. The weapons deficit was so severe that the Front commanders had to make occasional appeals for equipment.&lt;ref name="Ivan Khristoforovich Bagramyan 1977"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/bagramyan2/03.html|title=ВОЕННАЯ ЛИТЕРАТУРА --[ Мемуары ]-- Баграмян И.X. Так шли мы к победе|author=|date=|website=militera.lib.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The serious lack of ammunition hampered Soviet efforts in neutralizing German strongpoints, leading to heavy casualties in the assaults.&lt;ref name="K. Zhukov p 2"/&gt;

The lack of munitions did not only occur in the case of cannons and mortars, but also for small arms. During "the ammunitions famine" at Rzhev salient, on average, the Red Army only had 3 bullets for each rifle, 30 bullets for each submachine gun, 300 bullets for each light machine gun and 600 bullets for each heavy one. The "famine" of munitions in firearms and artillery pieces forced the Soviet army commanders, in many cases, to use tanks in the role of artillery; such inappropriate usage together with the outdated military thinking (which did not pay enough attention to the assault role of tank forces) sharply reduced the effectiveness of the tank units, preventing them from conducting deep penetration into the German defensive line.&lt;ref name="Pyotr Ilyich Kirichenko 2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/kirichenko_pi/05.html|title=ВОЕННАЯ ЛИТЕРАТУРА --[ Военная история ]-- Кириченко П. И. Первым всегда трудно|author=|date=|website=militera.lib.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the tank forces, although the Soviet possessed a large number of tanks, the numbers of low quality, damaged and outdated ones were also large. In the Bryansk, Western and Kalinin Front, the proportion of low quality tanks was 69% and the rates of damaged tanks about 41-55%. All the above facts meant that the Red Army in the Rzhev area did not have adequate preparation in terms of equipment, weapons and logistics.&lt;!--ref name="Alexey 2006"/--&gt;

The worst mistakes of the Red Army in 1942 at the Rzhev salients lies in the coordination and cooperation between its Fronts and the control of Stavka towards them. During the offensives in January and February 1942, instead of establishing a centralized command and control with tight cooperation between the Fronts, the Soviet Stavka and I. V. Stalin let each Front carry out their own assault without notable cooperation between the Fronts. Such separated and uncooperative assaults failed to achieve their goals and lead to the total failure of the whole offensives. To make matters worse, on 19 January 1942 Stalin suddenly retook the 1st Shock Army from the Western Front with a "very nonsense" reason. That unreasonable act severely weakened the right wing of the Western Front and lead to the failure of the offensive at the area Olenino - Rzhev - Osuga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/isaev_av4/09.html|title=ВОЕННАЯ ЛИТЕРАТУРА --[ Военная история ]-- Исаев А. Краткий курс истории ВОВ. Наступление маршала Шапошникова|author=|date=|website=militera.lib.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further errors in the Soviet's tactics and commands were the ambitious and unrealistic goals of the offensives. Early 1942, the Red Army had just recovered from the disastrous losses during the late half of 1941, therefore it was still very weak. Even the victory at the previous battle of Moskva was already a miracle for the Soviet Union. In every offensive, the aims and scale have to be correlative with the army's strength, but at the battles of Rzhev, the Soviet commanders demanded too much from their subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/research/sokolov2/08.html|title=ВОЕННАЯ ЛИТЕРАТУРА --[ Исследования ]-- Соколов Б.В. Неизвестный Жуков: портрет без ретуши в зеркале эпохи|author=|date=|website=militera.lib.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Last but not least, another "palindromic disease" of the Red Army in 1942 is the hesitation in retreating from threatened sectors. As a results, many Soviet units were trapped in a notable number of "pockets" when the Germans counter-attacked. In these cases, only the troops of 11th Cavalry Corps and 6th Tank Corps managed to escape successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/memo/russian/belov_pa/14.html|title=ВОЕННАЯ ЛИТЕРАТУРА --[ Мемуары ]-- Белов П. А. За нами Москва|author=|date=|website=militera.lib.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The escape of 33rd and 41st Army was conducted on time, but they failed to keep it secret and chose the wrong direction to move, leading to considerable casualties. And in the case of 11th Cavalry and 39th Army, the Stavka made a serious mistake when they planned to keep them in the Kholm-Zhirkovsky bridgehead for future attacks; however not only they failed to conduct any attacks but also they were surrounded and nearly destroyed during the [[operation Seydlitz|Seydlitz operation]].&lt;ref name="actualhistory.ru"/&gt;

===Germany===

====Strength====
After the Soviet winter counter-offensive of 1941–42, the Germans were able to securely hold and defend the salient against a series of large Soviet offensives. The operations led to disproportionately high Soviet losses and tied down large numbers of Soviet troops. The defense of the Salient provided the Germans with a base from which they could launch a new offensive against Moscow at a future time. The defensive positions created by the Germans after the retreat from Moscow were well constructed and placed. The Germans eventually withdrew from the positions only due to losses elsewhere in the war and were able to withdraw from the salient with minimal losses.

====Weakness====
German operations in 1941 directed at Moscow lasted too late into the year. Rather than stabilize the front and create defensive positions, the Germans pushed their forces forward and left them poorly prepared for the Soviet winter counteroffensive. The losses in men and equipment to Army Group Centre were considerable. The Army group lacked the strength to go back on the offensive in 1942.

After the front stabilized, the German Army tied down enormous amounts of manpower in holding salients from which they did not intend to exploit. This reduced the amount of manpower the Germans could devote to operations elsewhere on the front. The Germans also used some of their best formations, such as 9th Army, in a strictly static defensive role. The Rzhev salient had value and tied down disproportionate numbers of Soviet troops, but it is unclear if the salient was worth the loss of around 20 high quality divisions for offensive or defensive operations elsewhere in 1942.

The abandonment of the salient was necessary in 1943 to create reserves for the front as a whole. But the reserves and the strength created were mostly used up in the costly offensive directed at Kursk in 1943 ([[Operation Citadel]]).

==Controversies about the battles of Rzhev==
This part of the [[Second World War]] was poorly covered by Soviet military [[historiography]], and what coverage exists occurred only after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], when historians gained access to relevant documents. Exact dates of particular battles, their names, outcomes, significance, and even losses have not been fully clarified and there are still many controversies about these topics.

===Casualties of the Soviet forces===
In 2009, a television movie was aired in Russia entitled ''Rzhev: Marshal Zhukov's Unknown Battle'', which made no attempt to cover up the huge losses suffered by Soviet forces. As a consequence, there were public calls in Russia for the arrest of some of those involved in its production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/film-spurs-russia-to-squelch-criticism-of-soviet-war-tactics.htm|title=Film Spurs Russia to Squelch Criticism of Soviet War Tactics - HistoryNet|author=|date=|website=www.historynet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the movie, the casualties of Soviet forces are given as 433,000 KIA. The journalist [[Alina Makeyeva]], in an article of ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' newspaper which was published on 19 February 2009, wrote: "The number presented by the historian is too low. There must be more than one million Soviet soldiers and officers killed! Rzhev and its neighboring towns were completely destroyed."; however, Alina could not present any proof. Journalist Elena Tokaryeva in her article which was published in the newspaper ''The Violin'' (Russia) on 26 February 2009 also claimed that more than 1,000,000 Soviet soldiers were killed at Rzhev. The number of casualties again was raised with the claim of journalist Igor Elkov in his articled published in the ''Russian Weekly'' on 26 February 2009. Igor said: "The accurate number of casualties of both sides is still dubious. Recently, there are some opinions about from 1.3 to 1.5 million Soviet soldiers was killed. It may reach the number of 2 million".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rshew-42.narod.ru/|title=Ржевская битва 1941-1943 гг. Ржев - 1942.|first=Mole|last=Man|date=|website=rshew-42.narod.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All this data was heavily criticized by Reserve Colonel, Doctor of History A. V. Isayev. By providing the data in the stored documents of Russian Ministry of Defence, Isayev stated that [Igor Elkov]'s estimates were judgment[s] of people without adequate knowledge of history, and are the results of demagogic motivation under the slogan "every information must be shown to the people". Using very detailed documents with clear origins, A. V. Isayev proved the casualties of the Soviet forces as below:&lt;ref name="actualhistory.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://actualhistory.ru/isaev-rzhev2|title=Алексей Исаев.

*Total casualties of 20th, 30th, 31st Army and 2nd Guard Cavalry Corps from 21 to 30 November 1942 (first phase of Operation Mars): 7,893 KIA, 1,288 MIA, 28,989 WIA. (data of Ministry of Defence, code name TsAMO RF, shelf 208, drawer 2579, folder 16, volume ll, pp.&amp;nbsp;190–200).

A. V. Isayev also used the research of [[Colonel-General]] [[Grigoriy Krivosheyev|G. F. Krivosheyev]], his senior workmate at Russian Military History Institute and pointed out the common results between Isayev and Krivosheyev. On the Website "Soldier" of Russian Military History Institute, Isayev also said that the electronic draft of Krivosheyev was stolen and illegally used by the hackers, hence these drafts were completely deleted from the Institute Website. Nowadays, only the book whose copyright is held by Krivosheyev himself is recognized as legal document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soldat.ru/index.html|title=Наши новости|author=|date=|website=www.soldat.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rus-sky.com/history/library/w/|title=РОССИЯ И СССР В ВОЙНАХ XX ВЕКА. ПОТЕРИ ВООРУЖЕННЫХ СИЛ.|author=|date=|website=rus-sky.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, A. V. Isayev claimed that the Soviet casualties at Rzhev from January 1942 to March 1943 were 392,554 KIA and 768,233 WIA. The document film of Aleksey Vladimirovich Pivovarov was also heavily criticized by Isayev; he stated that in this film, many important events of the Rzhev battles are not mentioned such as the breakout of 1st Guard Cavalry Corps, the breakout of more than 17,000 remaining troops of 33rd Army during [[Operation Seydlitz]], and the breakout of the 41st Army. According to A. V. Isayev, if the film of Aleksey Vladimirovich Pivovarov and the thesis of Svetlana Aleksandrovna Gerasimova were true, many living people should have been recorded as KIA. Until now, there has not been any Russian articles or works which objects the arguments of A. V. Isayev.&lt;ref name="actualhistory.ru"/&gt;

===Role of G. K. Zhukov in Operation Mars===
The role of Zhukov in this infamous offensive is also a debated topic. American military historian, Colonel [[David M. Glantz]] claimed that G. K. Zhukov had to take the main responsibility in the tactical failure of this operation, and this is "the greatest defeat of Marshal Zhukov". In more detail, [[David Glantz]] asserted that Zhukov's command in this offensive was not careful, too ambitious, too clumsy and all these lead to a disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://militera.lib.ru/research/glantz_d03/index.html Гланц, Дэвид М. Крупнейшее поражение Жукова. Катастрофа Красной Армии в операции «Марс» 1942 г. — М.: ACT: Астрель, 2006. ''Bản gốc: David M. Glantz Zhukov's Greatest Defeat: The Red Army's Epic Disaster in Operation Mars, 1942. — Lawrence (KS): University Press Of Kansas, 1999.'' (David M. Glantz. Thất bại lớn nhất của Zhukov - Thảm họa của Hồng quân trong Chiến dịch "Sao Hỏa" năm 1942 – Moskva: ACT: Astrel, 2006.)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Antony Beevor]] disagreed with Glantz's comment. According to Beevor, at that time Zhukov had to concentrate on [[Operation Uranus]] at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad battlefield]] hence he had little time to care about what was happening at Rzhev, which is questionable considering that Operation Uranus was planned by Andrei Yeremenko and Andrei Vasilevsky, and Zhukov played little to no part in it.&lt;ref name="Beevor, Antony 2012"&gt;Beevor, Antony (2012). Chiến tranh thế giới thứ hai . London: W &amp; N. {{ISBN|0297844970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian authors Vladimir Chernov and Galina Yaroslavovna also disagreed with Glantz. They asserted that from 26 August 1942 Zhukov did not command the Western Front, and that from 29 August he had his hand busy with the serious matters at Stalingrad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soldat.ru/news/920.html|title=К 70-летию Погорело-Городищенской и Ржевско-Сычёвской операций 1942 года.|author=|date=|website=www.soldat.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been asserted{{By whom|date=June 2015}} that [[Stalin]] was actually the commander in charge of all the fronts at the Rzhev salient.&lt;ref&gt;S. M. Stemenko. The Soviet General Staff in War. Moskva 1985. page 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Zhukov only took part in the commanding at Rzhev during its later periods as a "firefighter" who was solving the serious problems of the battlefield at that moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/research/isaev_av_zhukov/10.html|title=ВОЕННАЯ ЛИТЕРАТУРА --[ Исследования ]-- Исаев А. В. Георгий Жуков|author=|date=|website=militera.lib.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Beevor asserted the comments of Glantz about Zhukov's responsibility were not correct.&lt;ref name="Beevor, Antony 2012"/&gt;

==The Title "City of Military Glory" of Rzhev==
Rzhev was conferred the status of "[[City of Military Glory]]" by the [[President of the Russian Federation]] [[Vladimir Putin]] on October 8, 2007, for "courage, endurance and mass heroism, exhibited by defenders of the city in the struggle for the freedom and independence of the Motherland".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act also caused heated debate and controversy. Many people believed that Rzhev should not be a "City of Military Glory" since it was the Nazi Germans who were "defenders of the city" against multiple and unsuccessful Soviet attacks. However, according to the law, being occupied does not prevent a city from receiving this honorary title. As long as its citizens, military personnel and government officers paid a large contribution for the Great Patriotic War and expressed great heroism, bravery and patriotism in these contributions, that is enough. Furthermore, the fierce and heroic resistance of Soviet citizens at Rzhev did not only occur during the 1942–1943 period, but also during the defence of Moscow in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graph.document.kremlin.ru/page.aspx?869039 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811182349/http://graph.document.kremlin.ru/page.aspx?869039 |archivedate=2014-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.kodeks.ru/document/90201672|title=О постановлении Правительства Российской Федерации от 13.07.2006 N 488, Телеграмма ФТС России от 23 августа 2006 года №ТФ-1938|author=|date=|website=docs.kodeks.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.kodeks.ru/document/902039651|title=О внесении изменения в Положение об условиях и порядке присвоения почетного звания Российской Федерации "Город воинской славы", утвержденное Указом Президента Российской Федерации от 1 декабря 2006 года N 1340, Указ Президента РФ от 27 апреля 2007 года №557|author=|date=|website=docs.kodeks.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to all these facts, Rzhev, Vyazma and many other cities have enough conditions to have the title "City of Military Glory," whether they were occupied or not.
