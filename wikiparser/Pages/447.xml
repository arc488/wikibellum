{{Campaignbox Pacific 1941}}

The '''Battle of Wake Island''' began simultaneously with the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] naval and air bases in [[Hawaii]] on the morning of 8 December 1941 (7 December in Hawaii), and ended on 23 December, with the surrender of the [[United States Armed Forces|American forces]] to the [[Empire of Japan]]. It was fought on and around the [[atoll]] formed by [[Wake Island]] and its minor islets of Peale and Wilkes Islands by the air, land, and naval forces of the Japanese Empire against those of the [[United States]], with [[Marine (military)|Marine]]s playing a prominent role on both sides.

The island was held by the Japanese for the duration of the [[Pacific War]] theater of [[World War II]]; the remaining Japanese garrison on the island surrendered to a detachment of [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marines]] on 4 September 1945, after the earlier surrender on 2 September 1945 on the battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}} in [[Tokyo Bay]] to General [[Douglas MacArthur]].&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/npswapa/extContent/Lib/liberation10.htm |title=War in the Pacific NHP: Liberation - Guam Remembers |publisher=nps.gov |accessdate=2014-09-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217094309/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/npswapa/extContent/Lib/liberation10.htm |archivedate=2012-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
January 1941, the [[United States Navy]] constructed a military base on the atoll. On 19 August, the first permanent military [[garrison]], elements of the [[Marine defense battalions|1st Marine Defense Battalion]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/wapa/indepth/extContent/usmc/pcn-190-003133-00/sec15.htm 1st Marine Defense Battalion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050825185331/http://www.nps.gov/wapa/indepth/extContent/usmc/pcn-190-003133-00/sec15.htm |date=August 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; deployed to Wake Island under the command of Major P.S. Devereux, USMC with a force of 450 officers and men.  Despite the relatively small size of the atoll, the Marines could not man all their defensive positions nor did they arrive with all their equipment, notably their air search radar units.&lt;ref&gt;with only 449 Marines on hand for the battles at Wake Island because one officer [Major Walter Baylor], USMC had been ordered to leave on 20 December with official reports.&lt;/ref&gt;   The Marine Detachment was supplemented by Marine Corps Fighter Squadron [[VMFA-211|VMF-211]], consisting of 12 [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|F4F-3 Wildcat]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s, commanded by Marine aviator Major [[Paul A. Putnam]], USMC.  Also, present on the island were 68 [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] personnel and about 1,221 civilian workers for the [[Morrison-Knudsen]] Civil Engineering Company. Forty-five [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] men (native [[Micronesia]]ns from the [[Mariana Islands]] and [[Guam]]) were employed by [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American Airways]] at the company's facilities on Wake Island, one of the stops on the [[Pan Am Clipper]] trans-Pacific amphibious air service initiated in 1935.
[[File:5 inch gun closeup USS Texas 1914 LOC 16025.jpg|left|thumb|5"/51 caliber gun on {{USS|Texas|BB-35|2}} 1914.]]
[[File:Ld3inch.jpg|left|thumb|3"/50 caliber gun aboard {{USS|Slater|DE-766|2}}]]

The Marines were armed with six [[5"/51 caliber gun|5-inch (127 mm)/51 cal]] pieces, originating from the old battleship {{USS|Texas|BB-35|6}}; twelve [[3"/50 caliber gun|{{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}}/50 cal]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s (with only a single working anti-aircraft [[Director (military)|director]] among them); eighteen [[M2 Browning machine gun|{{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} Browning]] [[heavy machine gun]]s; and thirty [[M1917 Browning machine gun|{{convert|.30|in|mm|2|abbr=on}}]] heavy, medium and light water- and air-cooled machine guns.

On 28 November, naval aviator [[Commander (United States)#Commander as a rank|Commander]] [[Winfield S. Cunningham]], USN reported to Wake to assume overall command of U.S. forces on the island. He had 10 days to examine the defenses and assess his men before war broke out.

On 6 December, Japanese Submarine Division 27 (''[[Japanese submarine Ro-65|Ro-65]]'', ''[[Japanese submarine Ro-66|Ro-66]]'', ''[[Japanese submarine Ro-67|Ro-67]]'') was dispatched from [[Kwajalein Atoll]] to patrol and blockade the pending operation.

On 8 December, just hours after receiving word of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] (Wake being on the opposite side of the [[International Date Line]]), 36 Japanese [[Mitsubishi G3M]]3 [[medium bomber]]s flown from bases on the [[Marshall Islands]] attacked Wake Island, destroying eight of the 12 F4F-3 Wildcats on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Urwin|first1=Gregory|title=Battle of Wake Island|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/634272/Battle-of-Wake-Island|website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining four Wildcats were in the air patrolling, but because of poor visibility, failed to see the attacking Japanese bombers. These Wildcats shot down two bombers on the following day.&lt;ref name="historyofwar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_wake_island.html|title=Battle of Wake Island, 8-23 December 1941|publisher=historyofwar.org|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the Marine garrison's defensive emplacements were left intact by the raid, which primarily targeted the aircraft. Of the 55 Marine aviation personnel, 23 were killed and 11 were wounded.

Following this attack, the Pan Am employees were evacuated, along with the passengers of the "[[Philippine Clipper]]," a passing [[Martin 130]] amphibious flying boat that had survived the attack unscathed. The Chamorro working men were not allowed to board the plane and were left behind.&lt;ref name=cunningham&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=W. Scott|title=Wake Island Command|year=1961|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston, MA|oclc=464544704}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more air raids followed. The main camp was targeted on 9 December, destroying the civilian hospital and the Pan Am air facility. The next day, enemy bombers focused on outlying Wilkes Island. Following the raid on 9 December, the guns had been relocated in case the Japanese had photographed the positions. Wooden replicas were erected in their place, and the Japanese bombers attacked the decoy positions. A lucky strike on a civilian dynamite supply set off a chain reaction and destroyed the munitions for the guns on Wilkes.&lt;ref name=cunningham /&gt;

==First landing attempt==
Early on the morning of 11 December, the garrison, with the support of the four remaining Wildcats, repelled the first Japanese landing attempt by the [[South Seas Force]], which included the light cruisers {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Yubari||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Tenryū||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Tatsuta|1918|2}}; the [[destroyer]]s {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Yayoi|1925|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Mutsuki||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kisaragi|1925|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Hayate|1925|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Oite|1924|2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Asanagi||2}}; two [[Momi class destroyer|''Momi''-class destroyer]]s converted to patrol boats (''[[Japanese destroyer Aoi (1920)|Patrol Boat No. 32]]'' and ''[[Momi class destroyer|Patrol Boat No. 33]]''), submarine tender ''[[Japanese submarine tender Jingei|Jingei]]'' and two troop transport ships (''[[MV Kinryu Maru|Kinryu Maru]]'' and ''[[Kongō Maru (1935)|Kongō Maru]]'') containing 450 [[Special Naval Landing Force]] troops. Submarines ''[[Japanese submarine Ro-65|Ro-65]]'', ''[[Japanese submarine Ro-66|Ro-66]]'', and ''[[Japanese submarine Ro-67|Ro-67]]'' patrolled nearby to secure the perimeter.

The US Marines fired at the invasion fleet with their six {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[Coastal artillery|coast-defense guns]]. Major Devereux, the Marine commander under Cunningham, ordered the gunners to hold their fire until the enemy moved within range of the coastal defenses. "Battery L", on Peale islet, sank ''Hayate'' at a distance of {{convert|4000|yd|m|abbr=on}} with at least two direct hits to her magazines, causing her to explode and sink within two minutes, in full view of the defenders on shore. Battery A claimed to have hit ''Yubari'' several times, but her action report makes no mention of any damage.{{sfn|Dull|2007|p=24}} The four Wildcats also succeeded in sinking the destroyer ''Kisaragi'' by dropping a bomb on her stern where the [[depth charge]]s were stored.{{Citation needed|reason=It is unclear where the bomb hit or if it was the cause of Kiwaragi's sinking|date=March 2020}} Both Japanese destroyers were lost with nearly all hands (there was only one survivor, from ''Hayate''), with ''Hayate'' becoming the first Japanese surface warship to be sunk in the war. The Japanese recorded 407 casualties during the first attempt.{{sfn|Dull|2007|p=24}} The Japanese force withdrew without landing, suffering their first setback of the war against the Americans.

After the initial raid was fought off, American news media reported that, when queried about reinforcement and resupply, Commander Cunningham was reported to have quipped, "Send us more Japs!" In fact, Cunningham sent a long list of critical equipment—including [[gunsights]], spare parts, and [[fire control system|fire-control]] [[radar]]—to his immediate superior: Commandant, 14th Naval District.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Cressman, ''A Magnificent Fight: Marines in the Defense of Wake Island'', World War II Commemorative Series, ed. Benis M. Frank (Marine Corps Historical Center: Washington, D.C.:1998). [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-C-Wake.html Electronic version - accessed 6-10-2006]&lt;/ref&gt; But the siege and frequent Japanese air attacks on the Wake garrison continued, without resupply for the Americans.

===Aborted USN relief attempt===
[[File:Vma211 insig.jpg|125px|right|thumb|VMA-211 Insignia.]]

Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher|Frank Fletcher]]'s Task Force 14 (TF–14) was tasked with the relief of Wake Island while Admiral [[Wilson Brown (admiral)|Wilson Brown]]'s [[Task Force 11|Task Force 11 (TF–11)]] was to undertake a raid on the island of [[Jaluit]] in the [[Marshall Islands]] as a diversion.&lt;ref name=Nasuti&gt;{{Cite web|first=Guy |last= Nasuti|authorlink=   |title=The Forsaken Defenders of Wake Island |website=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]]|date=December 2016 |url= https://www.history.navy.mil/browse-by-topic/wars-conflicts-and-operations/world-war-ii/1941/philippines/defenders-of-wake.html |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Task Force 11|TF–11]] consisted of the fleet carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}}, the [[fleet oiler]] {{USS|Neosho|AO-23|2}}, three heavy cruisers ({{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|2}}, {{USS|Chicago|CA-29|2}} and {{USS|Portland|CA-33|2}}), and the nine destroyers of [[Destroyer Squadron 1]] (squadron flagship {{USS|Phelps|DD-360|2}} along with {{USS|Dewey|DD-349|2}}, {{USS|Hull|DD-350|2}}, {{USS|MacDonough|DD-351|2}}, {{USS|Worden|DD-352|2}}, {{USS|Aylwin|DD-355|2}}, {{USS|Farragut|DD-348|2}}, {{USS|Dale|DD-353|2}}, and {{USS|Monaghan|DD-354|2}}).&lt;ref name=Nasuti /&gt;

At 21:00 on 22 December, after receiving information indicating the presence of two IJN carriers and two fast battleships (which were actually heavy cruisers) near Wake Island, [[Vice Admiral]] [[William Satterlee Pye|William S. Pye]]—the Acting [[CINCPAC|Commander in Chief]] of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|U.S. Pacific Fleet]]—ordered TF&amp;nbsp;14 to return to Pearl Harbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lundstrom|first1=John B.|title=The first team : Pacific naval air combat from Pearl Harbor to Midway|date=1990|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Md.|isbn=1-59114-471-X|edition=1st Naval Institute Press pbk.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oYE4AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT59#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second assault==

[[File:Japanese patrol boats 32 and 33.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese ''Patrol Boat No.32'' (left) and ''Patrol Boat No.33'']]

The initial resistance offered by the garrison prompted the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] to detach the [[Second Carrier Division]] ({{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sōryū||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hiryū||2}}) along with its escorts Cruiser Division 8 ({{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Chikuma|1938|2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Tone|1937|2}}), and Destroyer Division 17 ({{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Tanikaze|1940|2}} and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Urakaze|1940|2}}), all fresh from the assault on Pearl Harbor; Cruiser Division 6 ({{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Kinugasa||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Aoba||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Kako||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Furutaka||2}}), destroyer {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Oboro|1930|2}}, [[seaplane tender]] {{Ship|Japanese seaplane tender |Kiyokawa Maru||2}}, and transport ''[[MV Tenyo Maru (1935)|Tenyo Maru]]'' from the [[Battle of Guam (1941)|invasion of Guam]]; and Destroyer Division 29 ({{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Asanagi||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Yūnagi|1924|2}}) from the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|invasion of the Gilbert Islands]], to support the assault.&lt;ref name=Heinl&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/Heinl_The%20Defense%20of%20Wake.pdf?ver=2019-02-12-085233-467|first=R. D.|last=Heinly Jr.|authorlink=|title=The Defense of Wake|pages= |publisher=Division of Public Information - United States Marine Corps|date=|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second Japanese invasion force came on 23 December, composed mostly of the ships from the first attempt plus 1,500 Japanese marines. The landings began at 02:35; after a preliminary bombardment, the ex-destroyers ''Patrol Boat No. 32'' and ''Patrol Boat No. 33'' were beached and burned in their attempts to land the invasion force. After a full night and morning of fighting, the Wake garrison surrendered to the Japanese by mid-afternoon.

The US Marines lost 49 killed, two missing, and 49 wounded during the 15-day siege, while three US Navy personnel and at least 70 US civilians were killed, including 10 Chamorros, and 12 civilians wounded. 433 US personnel were captured. Japanese losses were 144 casualties, 140 SNLF and Army casualties with another 4 aboard ships.{{sfn|Dull|2007|p=26}} At least 28 land-based and carrier aircraft were also either shot down or damaged. The Japanese captured all men remaining on the island, the majority of whom were civilian contractors employed by the [[Morrison-Knudsen]] Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/npswapa/extContent/usmc/pcn-190-003119-00/sec6.htm A MAGNIFICENT FIGHT: Marines in the Battle for Wake Island] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512232731/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/npswapa/extContent/usmc/pcn-190-003119-00/sec6.htm |date=May 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Captain (United States)|Captain]] [[Henry T. Elrod]], one of the pilots from VMF-211, was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] for his action on the island during the second landing attempt, having shot down two Japanese [[Mitsubishi G3M|G3M Nell]]s and sunk the Japanese destroyer {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kisaragi|1925|2}}. A special military decoration, the [[Wake Island Device]], affixed to either the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] or the [[Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal]], was created to honor those who had fought in the defense of the island.

==Japanese occupation==
[[File:Wake Island attacked NAN12-1-43.jpg|thumb|Attack by ''Yorktown'' planes in October 1943]]

Fearing an imminent invasion, the Japanese reinforced Wake Island with more formidable defenses. The American captives were ordered to build a series of bunkers and fortifications on Wake. The Japanese brought in an {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} naval gun which is often incorrectly&lt;ref name="csu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marshall.csu.edu.au/Marshalls/html/Sapuk/Sapuk.html|title=Dirk H.R. Spennemann, 8-inch Coastal Defense Guns|publisher=marshall.csu.edu.au|accessdate=2014-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported as having been captured in Singapore. The U.S. Navy established a submarine blockade instead of an amphibious invasion of Wake Island. As a result, the Japanese garrison starved, which led to their hunting the [[Wake Island Rail]], an endemic bird, to extinction.

On 24 February 1942, aircraft from the carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}} attacked the Japanese garrison on Wake Island. U.S. forces bombed the island periodically from 1942 until Japan's surrender in 1945. On 24 July 1943, [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]s led by Lieutenant Jesse Stay of the 42nd Squadron (11th Bombardment Group) of the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]], in transit from [[Midway Atoll|Midway Island]], struck the Japanese garrison on Wake Island. At least two men from that raid were awarded [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]es for their efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Scearce, Phil; "Finish Forty and Home", pgs 113-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Future President [[George H. W. Bush]] also flew his first combat mission as a [[naval aviator]] over Wake Island. After this, Wake was occasionally raided but never attacked ''en masse''.

[[File:98 rock, Wake Island.jpg|thumb|right|The 98 rock]]
On 5 October 1943, American naval aircraft from {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|2}} raided Wake. Two days later, fearing an imminent invasion, Japanese Rear Admiral [[Shigematsu Sakaibara]] ordered the execution of the 98 captive American civilian workers who had initially been kept to perform forced labor. They were taken to the northern end of the island, blindfolded and executed with a machine gun. One of the prisoners (whose name has never been discovered) escaped, apparently returning to the site to carve the message "98 US PW 5-10-43" on a large coral rock near where the victims had been hastily buried in a mass grave. The unknown American was recaptured, and Sakaibara personally beheaded him with a ''[[katana]]''. The inscription on the rock can still be seen and is a Wake Island landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-98-rock|title=The 98 Rock|website=Atlas Obscura|language=en|access-date=2019-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 September 1945, the remaining Japanese garrison surrendered to a detachment of United States Marines under the command of Brigadier General [[Lawson H. M. Sanderson]], with the handover being officially conducted in a brief ceremony aboard the destroyer escort {{USS|Levy|DE-162|2}}.&lt;ref name="Moran2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jim Moran|title=Wake Island 1941: A battle to make the gods weep|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AaO6CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92|date=20 September 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-84908-604-2|pages=84, 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier the garrison received news that Imperial Japan's defeat was imminent, so the mass grave was quickly exhumed and the bones were moved to the U.S. cemetery that had been established on Peacock Point after the invasion, with wooden crosses erected in preparation for the expected arrival of U.S. forces. During the initial interrogations, the Japanese claimed that the remaining 98 Americans on the island were mostly killed by an American bombing raid, though some escaped and fought to the death after being cornered on the beach at the north end of Wake Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yorktownsailor.com/yorktown/massacre.html |title=Massacre on Wake Island |author=Maj.

==In popular culture==

The battle is depicted in the 1942 movie ''[[Wake Island (film)|Wake Island]]''.

The battle is prominently referenced in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' when [[Christopher Walken]]'s character, Captain Koons, describes how prize-fighter Butch Coolidge's grandfather, Dane, took part in and was killed in action at the Battle of Wake Island. Knowing that he would be killed in the coming assault, Dane gives the wristwatch, which the story arc in that part of the film later revolves around, to a stranger on a transport ship, requesting it be taken home, where it would eventually, via several painful insertions, find its way back to the young Butch.

The battle was prominently featured in the video game [[Battlefield 1942]], and its popularity amongst its player base inspired renditions of the island in several later installments of the [[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]] franchise.  To date it has also been featured in [[Battlefield 2]], [[Battlefield Heroes]], [[Battlefield 2142]], [[Battlefield 1943]], [[Battlefield 3]] and [[Battlefield V]]. Its appearance in Battlefield V is the only rendition since ''1942'' and ''1943'' to be set during World War II, with appearances in other franchises featuring [[People's Liberation Army]], the [[Russian Armed Forces]] and the [[United States Armed Forces]] fighting for control over the island in the present-day or the near future. 

In the computer strategy game [[Carriers at War]] there is a separate scenario depicting the relief attempt that was canceled by Admiral Pye. The US player commands the US carrier task forces and the task force built around the seaplane tender USS Tangier that was to reinforce the island.
