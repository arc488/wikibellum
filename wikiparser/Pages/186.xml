The '''Battle of Bloody Gulch''' took place around the [[Manoir de Donville]] or '''Hill 30''' ([[U.S. Army]] designation), approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} southwest of [[Carentan]] in [[Normandy]], France, on June 13, 1944.

It involved elements of the German [[17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen|17th SS Panzergrenadier Division]] and 6th [[Fallschirmjäger (World War II)|Fallschirmjäger]] [[Regiment]], and the American [[501st Parachute Infantry Regiment|501st]], [[502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment|502nd]] and [[506th Parachute Infantry Regiment|506th]], Parachute Infantry Regiments (PIR) of the [[U.S. 101st Airborne Division]], reinforced by elements of the [[U.S. 2nd Armored Division]] and the [[U.S. 29th Infantry Division]].

During the battle, the [[manor house]] of ''Manoir de Donville'' was the headquarters of the German forces. American soldiers nicknamed the road running past the manor "Bloody Gulch", after a place mentioned in a [[Destry Rides Again|popular western movie]].

== Battle ==
When the 101st Airborne entered the town of Carentan on June 12, 1944, after [[Battle of Carentan|heavy fighting]] on the two previous days, they met relatively light resistance. The bulk of the surviving German defenders (from the 6th Fallschirmjäger Regiment) had withdrawn to the southwest the previous night after a heavy [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] naval and [[artillery]] bombardment. Both sides realized the importance of the town: for the Americans, it was a link between [[Utah Beach]] and [[Omaha Beach]], and would provide a base for further attacks deeper into German-occupied France. For the Germans, recapturing Carentan would be the first step towards driving a wedge between the two U.S. landing beaches, severely disrupting and possibly even destroying the Allied invasion.

The remnants of the 6th Fallschirmjäger resupplied and were reinforced by [[assault guns]] and [[panzergrenadier]]s of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division on the night of June 12–13. The combined force counterattacked northeast towards Carentan at dawn on June 13, just as the 506th and 501st PIR were attacking southwest to enlarge the American defensive perimeter around the town. The 506th took the brunt of the attack, and by 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., the outnumbered and outgunned paratroopers were pushed almost back to the outskirts of the town.

Under intense German fire, F Company of the 506th's left flank broke and fell back. This exposed D Company's right flank, who also fell back, leaving [[E Company, 506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|E Company]] all alone. Cpt. Thomas P. Mulvey, the [[commanding officer]] of F Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.506infantry.org/hiswwii/his2ndbnwwiiarticle15.html |title=History 2nd Bn. |work=506infantry.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805024810/http://www.506infantry.org/hiswwii/his2ndbnwwiiarticle15.html |archivedate=August 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was relieved on the spot by the battalion commander.

When a German tank attempted to penetrate the left flank, two soldiers of E Company successfully destroyed it with a [[bazooka]]. Meanwhile, battalion headquarters stopped the retreat of D and F companies, pushing them forward 150 meters to cover the left flank.&lt;ref name="Band of Brothers"&gt;{{cite book |last= Ambrose |first= Stephen E. |coauthors= |title= [[Band of Brothers (book)|Band of Brothers]] |publisher= |date=September 2001 |isbn= 0-7434-2990-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd [[Battalion]] of the 502nd PIR took up positions to the right of the 506th, but by 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. they too had suffered many casualties, and the German attack was on the verge of breaking through their defenses.

At this critical point, sixty [[tank]]s from [[Combat command|Combat Command]] A of the [[U.S. 2nd Armored Division|2nd Armored Division]] and accompanied by infantry of the [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|29th Division]],&lt;ref name="Band of Brothers"/&gt; counterattacked southwest from Carentan at 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.,&lt;ref name="Band of Brothers"/&gt; inflicting severe casualties on the Germans and forcing them to withdraw at the loss of 4 tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=2nd Armored Division|url=https://archive.org/details/ndarmoreddivisio00smit|url-access=limited|last=Smith|first=Steven|publisher=Ian Allan Ltd|year=2003|isbn=0739437712|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ndarmoreddivisio00smit/page/n24 24]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American victory led to the linkup of forces from Utah and Omaha beaches, creating a secure [[lodgement]] area for further American operations.

The actions of the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment during the Graignes incident (better known as the [[Battle of Graignes]]) south-east of Carentan, played a part in the successful capture of Carentan and the Battle of Bloody Gulch. Had the mis-dropped paratroopers of the 507th not stopped the advance of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division, it is possible that the German division could have made it to Carentan before the 101st Airborne Division. Furthermore, the 507th caused the Germans significant losses in the few days that they were holding Graignes and this likely influenced the battle at the Bloody Gulch.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}
