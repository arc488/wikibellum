The '''Battle of the Campobasso Convoy''' was a naval engagement between three British [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyers]] and an Italian ''[[Regia Marina]]'' [[torpedo boat]] which took place off [[Cape Bon]] in the Mediterranean sea on the night of 3/4 May 1943. The Italians were escorting the 3,566 [[long ton]]s transport ship ''Campobasso'' to Tunisia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Whitley pg 183&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As the [[Tunisia Campaign|North Africa campaign]] neared its conclusion, {{HMS|Petard|G56|6}}, {{HMS|Paladin|G69|6}} and {{HMS|Nubian|F36|6}} were patrolling the waters off Cape Bon. On the night of 29/30 April, they made a sweep along the south coast of [[Sicily]] and sank a 2,000 ton merchant ship escorted by German [[E-boat]]s, without damage or casualties to themselves.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Connell pg 147-148&lt;/ref&gt;

A few days later ''Nubian'' ''Petard'' and ''Paladin'' from intelligence signals waited for an Italian convoy to cross their path. The Italian 3,566 ton merchant ''Campobasso'' had left [[Pantelleria|Pantelleria island]] loaded with bombs, land-mines, motor transport and other vital supplies to the beleaguered Axis force in Tunisia; it was one of the last four convoys sent from Italy to Tunisia. The merchant was then escorted by the Italian [[Spica-class torpedo boat|torpedo boat ''Perseo'']] soon after departure.&lt;ref name=autogenerated&gt;O'Hara pg 210-211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Ufficio storico della Marina Militare: ''La Marina italiana nella seconda guerra mondiale'', Volume 8. Stato maggiore della Marina Militare, 1958, pp. 245-6 {{in lang|it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action==
On the night of 3/4 May radar on the British destroyers picked up contacts heading towards the Tunisian coast.&lt;ref name=autogenerated/&gt; The Italian torpedo boat ''Perseo'', using a [[Metox radar detector|Metox]] radar detector, picked up the emissions from the British destroyers and warned Italian high command that the convoy had been found.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

All three British destroyers at once attacked targeting the Italian merchantman ''Campobasso''. Hits were scored by 4-inch gun and [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|"pom-pom"]] fire. ''Campobasso'' was hit numerous times, set alight and within half an hour tremendous and continuous explosions took place as the ammunition and bombs were ignited. The merchant sank quickly with the loss of 73 of the 103 men aboard, but ''Perseo'' responded and launched torpedoes to little effect; the British destroyers found the range and bombarded ''Perseo''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;  She was soon set on fire and exploded, sinking within sight of the last Axis stronghold with the loss of 133 of the 216 men aboard, including naval personnel on passage and her commanding officer Lt. Cdr. [[Saverio Marotta]], who refused to abandon his ship after being seriously wounded.&lt;ref name=autogenerated/&gt; The next day the Italian hospital ship ''Principessa Giovanna'' picked up 4 survivors from ''Campobasso'' (20 more men from the steamer reached the coast in a lifeboat) and 67 from ''Perseo.'' On 6 May the hospital ship was bombed and damaged by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft, with 54 killed and 52 wounded.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated0&gt;Harper, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A second convoy led by the Italian torpedo boat ''[[Italian torpedo boat Tifone|Tifone]],'' escorting the transport ''Belluno'' to Tunis and loaded herself with [[Aviation fuel|aviation spirit]] for [[Bizerte]], managed to evade the British destroyers after witnessing the destruction of ''Campobasso''. ''Tifone''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s convoy was the last Axis convoy to reach Africa during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La guerra italiana sul mare.

&lt;!-- Also on 4 May, another Italian convoy composed by the Italian [[Marinefährprahm#Motozattera (MZ)|lighter]] ''MZ 724'' and the water supply ship ''Scrivia'' successfuly evacuated 200 Italian troops from [[Bizerte]], reaching [[Cagliari]] undetected the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marina.difesa.it/storiacultura/storia/almanacco/Pagine/MotoZ/724.aspx|title=W 1 - Marina Militare|website=www.marina.difesa.it|language=it-IT|url-status=dead|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=April 2019}}--&gt;
At dusk on 8 May, as part of [[Operation Retribution (1943)|Operation Retribution]] ''Paladin'', with [[HMS Jervis|''Jervis'']] and ''Nubian'' bombarded [[Kelibia]], the most easterly point of the Cape Bon peninsula. This bombardment was repeated at dawn the next day until all Axis forces surrendered in Tunisia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated0/&gt;
