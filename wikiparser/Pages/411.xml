The '''Battle of Poznań''' ('''Battle of Posen''') during [[World War II]] in 1945 was a massive assault by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union's]] [[Red Army]] that had as its objective the elimination of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] garrison in the stronghold city of [[Poznań]] (Posen) in [[occupied Poland]]. The defeat of the German garrison required almost an entire month of painstaking reduction of fortified positions, intense [[urban combat]], and a final assault on the city's [[citadel]] by the Red Army, complete with [[medieval]] touches.&lt;ref&gt;''The storm operation recalled the breaking of a medieval siege'', Erickson, p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The city of [[Poznań]] (called ''Posen'' in German) lay in the western part of Poland which had been annexed by [[Nazi Germany]] following their [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, and was the chief city of [[Reichsgau Wartheland]].

By 1945, the Red Army advances on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] had driven the Germans out of eastern Poland as far as the [[Vistula River]]. The Red Army launched the [[Vistula-Oder Offensive]] on 12 January 1945, inflicted a huge defeat on the defending German forces, and advanced rapidly into western Poland and eastern Germany.

Certain cities which lay on the path of the Soviet advance were declared by [[Hitler]] to be ''[[German World War II strongholds|Festungen]]'' (strongholds), where the garrisons were ordered to mount last-ditch stands. Hitler hoped the ''Festung'' cities could hold out behind Soviet lines and interfere with the movement of supplies and lines of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, p. 249, Erickson, p. 523&lt;/ref&gt; Poznań was declared a ''Festung'' in January 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, p. 470, Baumann, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The city was defended by 40,000 German troops from a great variety of units including [[Volkssturm]], [[Luftwaffe]] ground forces, police, and highly motivated officer candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, p. 102. Some of the larger German units were the Fifth Infantry Officer Candidate School, Assault Gun Replacement Battalion 500, five ''Landesschützen'' battalions, one ''Volkssturm'' Battalion, Air Force Replacement Battalions I and IV, Fortress Antitank Battalion 102, Police Regiment Schallert, Kampfgruppe Lenzer, and six batteries of fortress artillery.&lt;/ref&gt; Facing them were the experienced [[Russian guards|Guards Rifle]] troops of General [[Vasily Chuikov|V. I Chuikov]]'s [[Eighth Guards Army (Soviet Union)|8th Guards Army]] – the victors of [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]].

The defenders made use of some of the surviving ''[[Festung Posen]]'' fortifications that had been built during [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] rule in the 19th century. The [[Fort Winiary]] citadel stood on a hill to the north of the city centre. Around the perimeter of the city were 18 massively-built [[Poznań Fortress|forts]], spaced at intervals of about 2 kilometres in a ring with a radius of about 5 kilometres. General Chuikov described the forts as
&lt;blockquote&gt;
. . . underground structures each with several storeys, the whole projecting above the surrounding terrain. Only a mound was visible above ground -- the layer of earth covering the rest. Each fort was ringed by a ditch ten metres wide and eight metres deep, with walls revetted with brickwork. Across the ditch was a bridge, leading to one of the upper storeys. Among the forts, to the rear, there were one-storey brick bunkers. These were clad in concrete almost a full metre thick, and were used as stores. The upper works of the forts were sufficiently strong to provide reliable protection against heavy artillery fire. . . . the enemy would be able to direct fire of all kinds against us both on the approaches to the forts and within them, on the rampart. The [[embrasure]]s were such that flanking fire from rifles and machine-guns could be directed from them.&lt;ref&gt;Chuikov, pp. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The city encircled==
Poznań lay on the main route between [[Warsaw]] and Berlin, and in German hands, it was a serious obstacle to any Soviet operation against the German capital. Thus, the Red Army had to clear the city of German troops before the final assaults designed to capture Berlin and end the war could begin.

On 21 January 1945 the Soviet [[Soviet 1st Guards Tank Army|1st Guards Tank Army]] forced a crossing of the [[Warta River]] north of the city, but by 24 January these bridgeheads had been abandoned in favor of better bridgeheads south of Poznań. Meanwhile, Red Army tank units had swept north and south of the city, capturing hundreds of German aircraft in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Moving further west, the Soviet tank units left the capture of the city to other Red Army forces.

By 25 January, the Soviet [[8th Guards Army]] had arrived and began a systematic reduction of the fortress. The following day, two of Poznań's forts in the south fell to a hasty assault conducted by the [[27th Guards Rifle Division|27th]] and [[74th Guards Rifle Division|74th Guards Rifle Divisions]]. This initial success allowed Chuikov's troops to penetrate the ring of forts and attack other forts from inside the city.

On 28 January, the German high command relieved ''[[Brigadier General|Generalmajor]]'' Ernst Mattern as the fortress commander and replaced him with a dedicated [[Nazi]], ''Generalmajor'' Ernst Gonell. Gonell imposed draconian discipline on the German garrison. In some instances, German troops attempting to surrender were shot by their own side.

Ultimately, the reduction of ''Festung Posen'' consumed the efforts of four divisions from Chuikov's army and two divisions of Colonel-General [[Vladimir Kolpakchi|V. Ia. Kolpakchi's]] [[69th Army (Soviet Union)|69th Army]]. The [[117th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|117th]] and [[312th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|312th Rifle Divisions]] of the [[91st Rifle Corps]] of 69th Army were deployed on the east side of the city. To the north, the [[39th Guards Rifle Division]] of Chuikov's [[28th Guards Rifle Corps]], and to the south, Chuikov's [[29th Guards Rifle Corps]] composed of the 27th, 74th, and [[82nd Guards Rifle Division|82nd Guards Rifle Divisions]] were arrayed against the ''Festung''.&lt;ref&gt;Chuikov, pp. 97-98, and Baumann, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; By the southwestern suburb of Junikowo, the [[11th Guards Tank Corps]] took up positions to block any German attempt at retreat.

==The capture of Poznań==
[[File:Demolished Town Hall in Poznan.jpg|thumbnail|right|Poznan Town Hall damaged in the fighting]]
In bitter combat that saw the outlying forts reduced and city blocks seized, the Soviets succeeded in pushing the German defenders towards the city center and the [[Poznań Citadel|citadel]]. By the beginning of February 1945, most of the city had been captured, and by 12 February, the Germans held only the imposing citadel.

''Generalmajor'' Gonell had previously believed that other German forces would attack and relieve his besieged forces, but by 15 February came to the realization that this was not going to happen. Incensed, he ordered his troops that were east of the Warta River to attempt to break out, and some 2,000 German soldiers managed to [[Infiltration tactics|infiltrate]] the Red Army lines and head west on the following night.

Arrayed against the citadel was the 29th Guards Rifle Corps, with the 27th Guards Rifle Division on the north, the 82nd Guards Rifle Division on the southwest, and the 74th Guards Rifle Division on the southeast. The final Soviet assault on the citadel started on 18 February. Before the Red Army troops lay a deep ditch matched by a steep rampart on the far side. In an odd echo of medieval warfare, the Soviet forces used ladders to cross this obstacle, but found themselves swept by fire from the citadel's [[redoubt]]s. These redoubts took the better part of three days to neutralize; one was silenced by flamethrowers and explosives, the other's line of fire was blocked by debris thrown in front of the firing ports by exasperated Soviet troops.

Having built an assault bridge, Red Army tanks and assault guns crossed into the main grounds of the citadel early on 22 February, commencing the final struggle for the old fortress. At this point, ''Generalmajor'' Gonell gave his troops permission to attempt to escape, but it was too late. Gonell refused to be captured and committed suicide by lying down on a flag and shooting himself in the head.

That evening, ''Generalmajor'' Mattern, once again in charge of the German forces, surrendered the remaining 12,000 German soldiers to General Chuikov.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Germans held out in Poznań for almost a month. Doubtlessly, their possession of the city complicated Soviet resupply efforts, but other influences had also convinced the [[Stavka]] to pause the Red Army advance at the [[Oder River]] instead of attempting to push on to Berlin in February 1945.

The battle left over half (90% in the city center) of Poznań severely damaged by artillery fire and the effects of infantry combat in the city blocks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The battle definitively reduced the old Prussian fortress system which today stands mostly as monuments to an earlier military era. Finally, the outcome of the battle simplified Soviet resupply efforts between Warsaw and the Oder River.

Over 5,000 German troopers who fell in the battle are buried at Milostowo cemetery. The Soviets are estimated to have lost over 12,000 men by the battle's midpoint around 3 February 1945.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Today, the [[Poznań Citadel]] site is a large park, in which are situated the remains of some of the fortifications, a memorial to the Red Army, military cemeteries, and a military museum containing exhibits relating to the 1945 battle.
