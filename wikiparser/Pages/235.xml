'''Operation Lumberjack''' was a [[military operation]] with the goal of capturing the west bank of the [[Rhine River]] and seizing key German cities, near the end of [[World War II]]. The [[First United States Army]] launched the operation in March 1945 to capture strategic cities in [[Nazi Germany]]  and to give the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] a foothold along the Rhine.

One unexpected outcome was the capture of the [[Ludendorff bridge]], a strategic railroad bridge across the Rhine, in the [[Battle of Remagen]]. Despite German attempts to destroy the bridge, Allied forces captured it intact and were able to use it for ten days to establish a [[bridgehead]] on the far side, before it finally collapsed at 3:00 PM on 17 March 1945 after months of aircraft bombing, direct artillery hits, near misses, and demolition attempts.

== Background ==
The Germans had repeatedly frustrated Allied efforts to cross the Rhine. With the [[21st Army Group]] firmly established along the Rhine, U.S. [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Omar Bradley]]'s [[Twelfth United States Army Group|12th Army Group]] prepared to execute Operation Lumberjack. Bradley’s plan called for the U.S. First Army to attack southeastward toward the juncture of the [[Ahr]] and Rhine Rivers and then swing south to meet [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George S. Patton|George Patton]], whose U. S. Third Army would simultaneously drive northeastward through the [[Eifel]]. If successful, Lumberjack would capture Cologne, secure the [[Koblenz]] sector, and bring the 12th Army Group to the Rhine in the entire area north of the [[Moselle River]]. The 12th Army Group also hoped to capture a large number of Germans.

Following Lumberjack, the Allies had planned for a pause along the Rhine while Montgomery's 21st Army Group began [[Operation Plunder]], a large, carefully planned movement across the Rhine near Düsseldorf and the Dutch border. Montgomery would then capture the Ruhr, the industrial heartland of Germany.&lt;ref name=zabecki/&gt;

During Operation Lumberjack, the U.S. Army's 9th Armored Division was tasked with mopping up elements of the German Army trapped on the west bank of the Rhine and to prevent a counterattack against the Ninth Army's flank. They were to secure the region between Mosel and the Duren-Cologne and to destroy the German army's capability to fight in that area. The First Army was to seize the entire region west of the Rhine. After capturing Cologne, the First Army was to wheel southeast and join up with Patton's Third Army. Patton was supposed to capture the Eifel Mountains and then the Mosel Valley, trapping the remainder of the German Seventh Army in the Eifel area.&lt;ref name=zabecki&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zabecki|first1=David T.|title=World War II in Europe : an encyclopedia|date=1999|publisher=Garland Publications|location=New York|isbn=978-0824070298|pages=1644|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gYDN-UfehEEC&amp;pg=PA1644|accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 75,000 German troops were on the western banks of the bridge. Their only escape route was across the Ludendorff bridge.

Written permission was required to destroy the bridge because on 14–15 October 1944, an American bomb had struck the [[Mülheim Bridge, Cologne|Mulheim Bridge]] in Cologne and hit the chamber containing the demolition charges, prematurely destroying the bridge. Hitler was angered by this incident and ordered those "responsible" for the destruction of the Mulheim Bridge to be court-martialed. He also ordered that demolition explosives should not be laid in place until the very last moment, when the Allies were within {{convert|5|mi}} of the bridge.&lt;ref name=atkinson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkinson|first1=Rick|title=Guns at Last Light: The War in Western Europe, 1944-1945|publisher=Picador|isbn=978-1250037817|pages=928|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mv2KAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA552|accessdate=29 November 2014|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|548}} The bridges should only be demolished following an order in writing from the officer in charge, and only as a last resort and at the last possible moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bull|first1=Stephen|title=D-day to Victory: With the Men and Machines that Won the War|date=2011|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Long Island City, NY|isbn=978-1849088381|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJrfZ2l4SJIC&amp;pg=PT260|accessdate=25 November 2014 |page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; This order left officers responsible for destroying bridges nervous about both the consequences if they blew up the bridge too soon and if they failed to blow it up at all.&lt;ref name=mcmullen&gt;{{cite web|last1=McMullen|first1=Emerson Thomas|last2=Rogers|first2=George|title=George Rogers and the Bridge at Remagen|url=http://www2.gasou.edu/facstaff/etmcmull/REMAGEN.htm|accessdate=19 November 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030228031634/http://www2.gasou.edu/facstaff/etmcmull/REMAGEN.htm|archivedate=February 28, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=halloran&gt;{{cite web|last1=Halloran|first1=Michael J.|title=The Bridge at Remagen|url=http://www.wood.army.mil/engrmag/PDFs%20for%20Jan-Apr%2009/Halloran.pdf|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MHOnline&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/articles/apathacrosstherhine.aspx |title=A Path Across the Rhine: The Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen, March 1945  |author=Parfitt, Allen |work=Military History Online  |publisher=Militaryhistoryonline.com |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradley launched Lumberjack on 1 March. In the north, the First Army rapidly exploited bridgeheads over the Erft River, entering [[Euskirchen]] on 4 March and Cologne on the fifth. Cologne was in U.S. Army control by the 7th. The First Army then pushed towards the [[Ahr|Ahr River]] valley, the likely point of retreat for what was left of the German Army's LXVI and LXVII Korps.&lt;ref name=zabecki/&gt;

The U.S. Third Army met some resistance along the [[Siegfried Line]] and the Prüm and Kyll Rivers. On 4 March at Bitburg, the [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division]] cut through the German lines. Taking advantage of the breach, the Fourth Armored Division struck out on a {{convert|45|mi}} drive to the Rhine in less than five days. While losing only 100 casualties, they cost the Germans 5,700 killed and wounded. The Fourth Armored barely missed the chance to capture a bridge at [[Urmitz]].&lt;ref name=zabecki/&gt;

While moving towards the Ahr, the U.S. [[9th Armored Division (United States)|9th Armored Division]] on the right flank of the First Army had moved swiftly towards the Rhine. The closer the division got to the Rhine, the more quickly it advanced. The speed of their movement towards the Rhine surprised the Germans.&lt;ref name=lonesentry&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lonesentry.com/gi_stories_booklets/9tharmored/index.html |title=The 9th: The Story of the 9th Armored Division |accessdate=June 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; About {{convert|20|km}} upstream from Bonn, they unexpectedly found the [[Ludendorff Bridge|Ludendorff railroad bridge]] still standing.

=== Battle of Remagen ===
{{main|Battle of Remagen}}
During Operation Lumberjack, on 7 March 1945, when troops of the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[9th Armored Division (United States)|9th Armored Division]] [[Combat Command]] B, [[9th Armored Engineer Battalion]] reached the river, they were very surprised to see that the [[Ludendorff Bridge|railroad bridge]] was still standing.&lt;ref name=remegen/&gt; It was one of the two damaged but usable bridges over the [[Rhine]] (the other being the [[Wesel Railway Bridge]]). U.S. forces were able to capture the bridge. The Rhine was the last natural line of defense that the Germans hoped could be used to substantially resist the Western Allied advance. Up to then, crossings had been limited to small infantry reconnaissance patrols by boat.

When word that the bridge was still standing reached General William Hoge, commander of Combat Command B, he ordered the 27th Armored Infantry Battalion to advance into Remagen with support from the 14th Tank Battalion. After German demolition charges failed to destroy the bridge, the U.S. troops [[Battle of Remagen|captured the bridge]] and in the next ten days 25,000 troops comprising six divisions established a wide beachhead on the eastern side of the Rhine.&lt;ref name=remegen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/worldwarii/p/remagen.htm |title=Bridge at Remagen|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on war plans ===
The capture of the bridge convinced the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Allied high command]] in Western Europe that they could envelop the German industrial area of the [[Ruhr]] as opposed to focusing primarily on General [[Bernard Montgomery]]'s plan, [[Operation Plunder]], which would bring the [[British 21st Army Group]] across the Rhine into northern Germany.

The unexpected availability of the first major crossing of the Rhine, Germany's last major natural barrier and line of defense, caused [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Allied high commander]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] to alter his plans to end the war.&lt;ref name=sarasota&gt;{{cite news |title=Eisenhower|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19450422&amp;id=ZtciAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oGQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3724,1237923 |publisher=Sarasota-Herald Tribune |date=April 22, 1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenhower"&gt;{{cite book |author=Dwight Eisenhower |authorlink=Dwight D.

The Allies were able to get six divisions across the Rhine before the [[Ludendorff Bridge]] collapsed ten days after it was captured on 17 March. Twenty-five soldiers were killed or went missing and three died later from injuries; 63 others were injured.&lt;ref name =Hechler&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.appalachiacoal.com/Remagen%20Bridge%20jul14.01.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611110151/http://www.appalachiacoal.com/Remagen%20Bridge%20jul14.01.htm|archivedate=June 11, 2009|author=Lewis Betty |title=Interview with Ken Hechler, WWII Historian, Author of ''The Bridge at Remagen'' |date=2001-07-14 |accessdate=March 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|201}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Last/USA-E-Last-11.html Charles B. MacDonald A Rhine Bridge at Remagen] p.230 gives casualties as 28 Killed/93 injured&lt;/ref&gt; Before it collapsed, five U.S. divisions had already used it and two adjacent tactical bridges to cross into Germany, creating a well-established bridgehead almost {{convert|40|km|sp=us}} long, extending from Bonn in the north almost to Koblenz in the south, and {{convert|10|to|15|km|sp=us}} deep.

The bridge was not rebuilt after the war. However, the bridge towers remain and in 1980 a peace museum was opened to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bruecke-westremagen.de/index_en.htm ''Peace Museum Bridge at Remagen''] Website of the museum. Retrieved July 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Operation Lumberjack succeeded in clearing the Rhine north of Mosel of effective German forces. The Allies destroyed four corps of the German 15th and 7th Armies. The capture of the bridge at Remagen was an unexpected bonus that advanced the timetable for crossing the Rhine.&lt;ref name=zabecki/&gt; Patton and Bradley were able to move up their scheduled crossings of the Rhine.

General [[Albert Kesselring]] described the battle as the "Crime of Remagen. It broke the front along the Rhine." [[Hermann Göring]] said that the capture of the bridge "made a long defense impossible." Major General [[Carl Wagener]], chief of staff to Field Marshall Walter Model, said that capturing the bridge signaled the end of the war for the Germans:

{{quote|The Remagen affair caused a great stir in the German Supreme Command. Remagen should have been considered a basis for termination of the war. Remagen created a dangerous and unpleasant abscess within the last German defenses, and it provided an ideal springboard for the coming offensive east of the Rhine. The Remagen bridgehead made the other crossing of the Rhine a much easier task for the enemy. Furthermore, it tired German forces which should have been resting to withstand the next major assault.&lt;ref name=congressionalrecord&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering World War II|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1995-03-07/html/CREC-1995-03-07-pt1-PgH2782.htm|publisher=Congressional Record Volume 141, Number 42|accessdate=9 December 2014|date=March 7, 1995|quote=Eisenhower's chief of staff, his alter ego, General Walter Bedell Smith, termed the Remagan Bridge worth its weight in gold.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
