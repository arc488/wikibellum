The '''Battle of Attu''', which took place on 11–30 May 1943, was a battle fought between forces of the [[United States]], aided by [[Canada|Canadian]] reconnaissance and fighter-bomber support, and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] on [[Attu Island]] off the coast of the [[Territory of Alaska]] as part of the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]] during the [[American Theater (World War II)|American Theater]] and the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]]. 

The more than two-week battle ended when most of the Japanese defenders were killed in brutal [[hand-to-hand combat]] after a final [[banzai charge|''banzai '' charge]] broke through American lines.

==Background==
The strategic position of the islands of Attu and [[Kiska]] off Alaska's coast meant their location could control the sea lanes across the Northern Pacific Ocean. Japanese planners believed control of the [[Aleutians]] would therefore prevent any possible U.S. attacks from Alaska. This assessment had already been inferred by U.S. General [[Billy Mitchell]] who told the U.S. Congress in 1935, "I believe that in the future, whoever holds Alaska will hold the world. I think it is the most important strategic place in the world."

On 7 June 1942, six months after the United States [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|entered World War II]], the 301st Independent Infantry Battalion from the [[Northern District Army (Japan)|Japanese Northern Army]] landed unopposed on Attu. The landings occurred one day after the invasion of nearby [[Kiska]]. The U.S. military now feared both islands could be turned into strategic Japanese airbases from which aerial attacks could be launched against mainland Alaska and the rest of the [[West Coast of the United States|U.S. West Coast]].

In [[Walt Disney]]′s 1943 film, ''[[Victory Through Air Power (film)|Victory Through Air Power]],'' the use of the Aleutian Islands for American long-range bombers to bomb Japan was postulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1iPBvwaIkI|title=YouTube|work=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recapture==
[[File:Capture of Attu 1943.jpg|thumb|left|Map showing the recapture of [[Attu Island|Attu]] in 1943]]

On 11 May 1943, units from 17th Infantry, of Maj. Gen. [[Albert E. Brown]]'s [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th U.S. Infantry Division]] made amphibious landings on Attu ("Operation Landcrab"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Battle of Attu|url=http://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/battle-of-attu|publisher=The History Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to retake the island from [[Japanese Imperial Army]] forces led by Colonel [[Yasuyo Yamasaki]]. Despite heavy naval bombardments of Japanese positions, the American troops encountered strong entrenched defenses that made combat conditions tough. [[Arctic]] weather and [[frostbite|exposure-related injuries]] also caused numerous casualties among U.S. forces. After two weeks of relentless fighting, however, American units managed to push the Japanese defenders back to a pocket around [[Chichagof Harbor]].

On 21–22 May 1943, a powerful Japanese fleet assembled in Tokyo Bay in preparation for a sortie to repel the American attempt to recapture Attu. The fleet included the carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shōkaku|''Shōkaku'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'yō|''Jun'yō'']], [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiyō|''Hiyō'']], the battleships [[Japanese battleship Musashi|''Musashi'']], [[Japanese battleship Kongō|''Kongō'']], [[Japanese battleship Haruna|''Haruna'']], and the cruisers [[Japanese cruiser Mogami (1934)|''Mogami'']], [[Japanese cruiser Kumano|''Kumano'']], [[Japanese cruiser Suzuya (1934)|''Suzuya'']], [[Japanese cruiser Tone (1937)|''Tone'']], [[Japanese cruiser Chikuma (1938)|''Chikuma'']], [[Japanese cruiser Agano|''Agano'']], [[Japanese cruiser Ōyodo|''Ōyodo'']], and eleven destroyers. The Americans, however, recaptured Attu before the fleet could depart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Imperial Japanese Navy Page|title=Zuikaku Tabular Record of Movement (TROM)|url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/Zuikak.htm|publisher=Jonathan Parshall|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 1943, without hope of rescue, Yamasaki led his remaining troops in a [[Banzai charge|''banzai'' charge]].  The surprise attack broke through the American front line positions. Shocked American rear-echelon troops were soon fighting in hand-to-hand combat with Japanese soldiers. The battle continued until almost all of the Japanese were killed. The charge effectively ended the battle for the island, although U.S. Navy reports indicate that small groups of Japanese continued to fight until early July 1943. In 19 days of battle, 549 soldiers of the 7th Division were killed and more than 1,200 injured. The Japanese lost over 2,351 men, including Yamasaki; only 28 prisoners were taken.&lt;ref name="US National Park Service"&gt;[https://www.nps.gov/articles/battle-of-attu.htm US National Park Service]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Attu was the last action of the Aleutian Islands Campaign. The Japanese Northern Army secretly evacuated its remaining garrison from nearby [[Kiska]], ending the Japanese occupation in the [[Aleutian Islands]] on 28 July 1943.

The loss of Attu and the evacuation of Kiska came shortly after the death of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], who was killed by [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|American aircraft]] in [[Operation Vengeance]]. These defeats compounded the demoralizing effect of losing Yamamoto on the Japanese High Command.&lt;ref name="toland444"&gt;[[John Toland (author)|John Toland]], ''[[The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945]]'' New York:Random House (1970) p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the losses, Japanese propaganda attempted to present the Aleutian Island campaign as an inspirational epic.&lt;ref name= "toland444"/&gt;
