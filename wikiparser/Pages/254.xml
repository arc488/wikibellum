The '''Action of 27 March 1942''' was a naval battle fought between the [[United States]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] during [[World War II]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. While patrolling 300 miles off [[Norfolk, Virginia]], an American [[Q-ship]] encountered a [[U-boat]] and a short surface engagement ensued.&lt;ref name="Beyer"&gt;Beyer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uboat1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/allies/merchants/1476.html |title=USS Atik (AK 101) (American Q-ship) - Ships hit by German U-boats during WWII |publisher=uboat.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uboat2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uboat.net/boats/successes/details.php?boat=123 |title=Ships hit by U-123 - U-boat Successes - German U-boats |publisher=uboat.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MW-3983-23, Lorient, Einlaufen von U-123.jpg|200px|left|thumb|''U-123'' at [[Lorient]] in February 1942.]]
{{USS|Atik|AK-101|6}}, under [[Lieutenant Commander]] Harry Lynnwood Hicks, was originally a merchantman named SS ''Carolyn'' which was converted to a Q-ship after America's entry into World War II. ''Atik'' displaced 6,610 tons with a crew of 141 men and an armament of four {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} [[naval gun]]s, eight [[machine gun]]s and six [[K-gun]]s. It was about 5:00 pm on 27 March when {{GS|U-123|1940|2}} detected ''Atik''. Over two hours later at 19:37, [[Kapitänleutnant]] [[Reinhard Hardegen]] fired a spread of G7e torpedoes from a surfaced position and one of them struck ''Atik''{{'}}s [[Bow (ship)|bow]] on port side. The Q-ship caught on fire and started to list slightly. Lieutenant Commander Hicks apparently decided that the only way to lure the U-boat within range of his guns was by ordering a lifeboat to be lowered on the starboard side. The trick worked so when ''U-123'' was maneuvering to starboard, around ''Atik''{{'}}s stern, she opened fire with all of her weapons, including [[depth charge]]s. The first shots fell short of the U-boat and the others deflected. The American machine gunners were successful though and the U-boat's bridge was slightly damaged and one German [[midshipman]] was mortally wounded.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uboat1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uboat2"/&gt;

Immediately after the Americans opened fire, Captain Hardegen ordered his deck gun into action and fled out of ''Atik''{{'}}s range before diving but at 21:29 ''U-123'' attacked again to finish the Q-ship off. After firing and striking the ship with one more torpedo, ''Atik'' still remained mostly afloat with her bow slowly settling. The remainder of the American crew appeared to be evacuating their ship at this point so the Germans deemed her as no longer being a threat and they surfaced at 22:27 pm to watch ''Atik'' sink. Twenty-three minutes later at 22:50 ''Atik'' exploded and then a [[gale]] blew in, killing all of the 141 American sailors. The one German casualty was buried at sea ten minutes later and then ''U-123'' escaped. An [[SOS]] was received by three nearby American warships, {{sclass-|Clemson|destroyer}} {{USS|Noa|DD-343|6}}, Q-ship {{USS|Asterion|AK-100|6}} and [[List of auxiliaries of the United States Navy#Fleet Tugs (AT)|fleet tug]] USS ''Sagamore''&amp;mdash;but when they arrived there was nothing but wreckage. American aircraft also searched for several days though nothing but debris and five empty lifeboats were found.&lt;ref name="Beyer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uboat1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="uboat2"/&gt;
