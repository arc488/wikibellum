The '''Baltic Operation''', also known as the Defensive operation in Lithuania and Latvia encompassed the operations of the [[Red Army]] from 22 June to 9 July 1941 conducted over the territories of the occupied [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] in response to an offensive launched by the [[Wehrmacht|German army]].

==Operational parts==
The operation consisted of three distinct smaller operations
:[[Border Defensive Battles]] (22–24 June 1941)
::[[Battle of Raseiniai]] also known as the 'Kaunas Counterattack'
:[[Šiauliai Counter-Offensive Operation]] (24–27 June 1941)
:[[Defense of the Hanko Naval Base]] (22 June–2 December 1941)

==Execution==
The principal Red Army formations of the operation were the [[Northwestern Front]] and the [[Baltic Fleet]], with the major ground forces consisting of the [[8th Army (Soviet Union)|8th]] (commander General Major P.P. Sobennikov), [[11th Army (Soviet Union)|11th]] (commander General Lieutenant Morozov) and later [[27th Army (Soviet Union)|27th]] Armies.

The operation was conducted after the forces of the [[Baltic Military District|Baltic Special Military District]] were alerted in the morning of 22 June 1941 following a surprise attack by the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]''{{'}}s [[Army Group North]] which consisted of the [[18th Army (Wehrmacht)|18th]], [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|16th]] Field Armies and the [[4th Panzer Group]], and elements of the [[3rd Panzer Army#3rd Panzer Group|3rd Panzer Group]], supported by the [[Luftflotte 1]].{{sfn|Bishop|2005|p=69}}

On 22 June, the Soviet 8th Army was positioned in northern Lithuania opposed by the German 18th Army. The Soviet 11th Army defended the rest of the Lithuanian border with [[East Prussia]] and sought to contain the attacks of the German 16th Army and the 4th Panzer Group.

While the Soviet 8th Army retreated along the [[Jelgava]]–[[Riga]]–[[Tartu]]–[[Narva]]–[[Pskov]] direction, the Soviet 11th Army sought to initially hold the [[Kaunas]]–[[Vilnius]] [[sector (military)|sector]] of the front, but was forced to retreat along the [[Daugavpils]]–Pskov–[[Novgorod]] direction. These [[Withdrawal (military)|withdrawals]], although costly in losses of personnel and materiel, avoided major [[encirclement]]s experienced by the Fronts to the south, and succeeded in delaying the Army Group North sufficiently to allow preparation for the defence of [[Leningrad]].

The operation was not a single continuous withdrawal, but was punctuated by short-lived [[counterattack]]s, [[counterstroke]]s or [[counteroffensive]]s.{{sfn|Glantz|2005|p=70}}
