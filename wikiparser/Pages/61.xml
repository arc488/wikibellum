The '''Raid on Souda Bay''' was an  assault by [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] small craft on [[Souda Bay]], [[Crete]], during the first hours of 26 March 1941. The [[Royal Navy]] [[heavy cruiser]] {{HMS|York|90|6}} and the [[German occupation of Norway|Norwegian]] tanker ''Pericles'' were disabled by the Italian motor launches and eventually lost.

==Background==
Souda is a naturally protected harbour on the northwest coast of the island. It had been chosen as a target by the {{lang|it|[[Decima Flottiglia MAS]]}} months before because of the almost continuous Allied naval activity there.&lt;ref name=Borg&gt;{{lang|it|Borghese}}, page 77&lt;/ref&gt; Air [[reconnaissance]] had spotted a number of naval and auxiliary steamers at anchor in Souda Bay, Crete.

On 25 March 1941, the Italian [[Sella-class destroyer]]s ''Crispi'' and ''Sella'' departed from [[Leros]] island in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] at night, each one carrying three {{convert|2|LT|t|abbr=on}} motor assault boats of the Decima known as ''{{lang|it|[[MT explosive motorboat|Motoscafo da Turismo]]}}'' (MT).&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Jack and Massignani, Alessandro (2004). ''The Black Prince And The Sea Devils: The Story Of Valerio Borghese And The Elite Units Of The Decima Mas''. Da Capo Press, page 39. {{ISBN|0306813114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each MT (nicknamed ''{{lang|it|barchino}}'' - "little boat") carried a {{convert|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}} explosive charge inside its [[bow (ship)|bow]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadkovich, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; The MTs were specially equipped to make their way through obstacles such as [[torpedo nets]]. The pilot would steer the assault craft on a collision course at his target ship, and then would jump from his boat before impact and warhead detonation.&lt;ref name= Green&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, page 141&lt;/ref&gt;

==The attack==
[[File:HMS York (90) damaged at Souda Bay May 1941.jpg|thumb|left|''York'' and ''Pericles'' both crippled and beached. A [[Short Sunderland]] flying boat is landing between them]]
At 23:30, the MT were released by the destroyers {{convert|10|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} off Souda. Once inside the bay, the six boats, under the command of Lieutenant [[Luigi Faggioni]], identified their targets: the heavy cruiser HMS ''York'', a large tanker (the Norwegian ''Pericles'' of {{convert|8300|LT|t|abbr=on}}), another tanker and a cargo ship.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; At 4:46, two MTs hit HMS ''York'' amidships, flooding her aft boilers and magazines, and the ship was beached by her own crew to avoid capsizing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-06CA-York.htm Naval-History.net: HMS ''York'']&lt;/ref&gt; Two seamen were killed by the explosions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-history.net/xDKCas1941-03MAR.htm#prof Naval-History.net: 26 March entry]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pericles'' was severely damaged and settled on the bottom, while the other tanker and the cargo ship were sunk, according to Italian sources.&lt;ref&gt;Borghese, pp. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; According to British reports, the other ''barchini'' apparently missed their intended targets, and one of them ended stranded on the beach.&lt;ref&gt;Borghese, page 80&lt;/ref&gt; The [[antiaircraft warfare|antiaircraft guns]] of the base opened fire randomly, believing that the base was under air attack.&lt;ref&gt;Borghese, page 82&lt;/ref&gt;

All six of the Italian sailors: Luigi Faggioni, Alessio de Vito, Emilio Barberi, Angelo Cabrini, Tullio Tedeschi, and Lino Beccati, were captured.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Sella at anchor.jpg|thumb|260px|Destroyer ''Sella'', one of the mother ships of the explosive motor boats]]

HMS ''York'' was disabled. After a salvage operation involving a submarine dispatched from [[Alexandria]] was abandoned, she was wrecked with demolition charges by her crew before the [[Battle of Crete|German capture of Crete]],&lt;ref&gt;Borghese, pp. 83-84&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''Pericles'', taken in tow by destroyers, sank on 14 April 1941 en route to Alexandria during a storm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-history.net/xDKWW2-4104-31APR01.htm#prof Naval-History.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sinking of HMS ''York'' was the source of a controversy between the ''Regia Marina'' and the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' over credit for her sinking. The matter was resolved by British war records and by the ship's own war log, captured by Italian naval officers who boarded the half-sunk cruiser.&lt;ref&gt;The Italians seized the following naval message from Captain Portal to his Chief Engineering Officer: "Please take statements from all men who were in boiler and engine rooms when the ship was struck on the 26th, also from any men who can bear witness as to the R.A.s who were lost, being in the engine room. I would like you also to make rough notes now, while events are fresh in your mind, of sequence of damage reports and appreciations as time went on. Also a log of events since we started pumping out. R.P." Borghese, page 83&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the hull of HMS ''York'' was raised and towed to [[Bari]], and scrapped there by an Italian shipbreaker in March 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-06CA-York.htm#prof Naval-History.net]&lt;/ref&gt;
