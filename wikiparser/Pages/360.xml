'''Battle of Auvere''' was a battle in [[Estonia]], starting on July 20, 1944 and ending on July 25. It was a part of the [[World War II]]  [[Battle of Narva (1944)|campaign in Narva]].

The Soviet [[8th Army (Soviet Union)|8th Army]] started attacking the [[Auvere]] Station on July 20 with artillery fire. The defenders had some losses. The Estonians and Germans (of the [[11th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|11th (East Prussian) Infantry Division]]&lt;ref&gt;Although the name "East Prussian" is often associated with this division (two regiments were formed in East Prussian regions), the division also had personnel from other areas of Germany, particularly the Rhineland.&lt;/ref&gt;) had built trenches and dug themselves into foxholes. In the morning of July 24, the Soviet assault commenced with 30–50 batteries firing 17,000 shells and grenades (2,000 tons),&lt;ref name=hiio&gt;{{Cite book|author=Toomas Hiio|year=2006|pages=1035–1094|chapter=Combat in Estonia in 1944|editor1=Toomas Hiio |editor2=Meelis Maripuu |editor3=Indrek Paavle |title=Estonia 1940–1945: Reports of the [[Estonian International Commission for the Investigation of Crimes Against Humanity]]|location=Tallinn}}&lt;/ref&gt; inflicting significant casualties to the Estonian 45th Regiment in [[Auvere]] and the 44th Infantry Regiment in the borough of [[Sirgala]].&lt;ref name=hiio/&gt;

After two hours of preparatory artillery fire, the two regiments were attacked from the air. Three German and eight Soviet bombers were shot down in air combat. Under artillery cover, the Soviet 122nd [[Rifle corps (Soviet)|Rifle Corps]] and a tank brigade pierced to the German positions, while the 117th Rifle Corps encircled the Estonian regiment,&lt;ref name=krivo&gt;{{Cite book|title=Битва за Нарву, февраль-сентябрь 1944 год (The Battle for Narva, February–September 1944)|author=Евгений Кривошеев|author2= Николай Костин|language=Russian|location=Tallinn|publisher=Eesti raamat|year=1984|chapter=I.

Relieved by [[Paul Albert Kausch]]'s Kampfgruppe (the "Nordland" Tank Battalion with additional units) and three [[Nebelwerfer|rocket artillery launcher]]s, the Estonians went on for a counterattack.&lt;ref name=saagi/&gt; The 44th Regiment was saved by the swift movement of artillery behind them clearing their previous positions of Soviet troops.&lt;ref name=buxa&gt;{{Cite book|author=W.Buxa|year=1952|title=Weg und Schicksal der 11.

The attempts by the 117th and the 122nd Rifle Corps to break through were repelled in a similar way, causing them to lose 3,000 men, 17 planes and 29 tanks, compared to the loss of 800 troops of army detachment "Narwa".&lt;ref name=paulman&gt;{{Cite book|language=Russian|author =F.I.Paulman|title=Ot Narvy do Syrve (From Narva to Sõrve)|publisher=Eesti Raamat|location=Tallinn|year=1980|pages=7–119|chapter=Nachalo osvobozhdeniya Sovetskoy Estoniy}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the next day, the Soviet 8th Army tried to capture the German positions again, but they were repelled by machine guns.&lt;ref name=paulman/&gt;
