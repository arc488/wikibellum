The '''Second Sino-Japanese War''' was a military conflict that was primarily waged between the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] and the [[Empire of Japan]] from July 7, 1937, to September 2, 1945. The start of the war is typically considered to be the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] in 1937, in which a dispute between Japanese and Chinese troops escalated into a full-scale invasion. Some sources in the modern [[China|People's Republic of China]] date the beginning of the war to the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/881785/china-is-rewriting-textbooks-so-its-eight-year-war-of-resistance-against-japan-is-now-six-years-longer/|title=China is rewriting textbooks so its "eight-year war of resistance" against Japan is now six years longer|last=Huang|first=Zheping|last2=Huang|first2=Zheping|website=Quartz|language=en|access-date=2019-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, it is known as the '''War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression''' ({{zh|t=中國抗日戰爭|s=中国抗日战爭|p=Zhōngguó Kàngrì Zhànzhēng}}).

China fought Japan with aid from the [[Soviet Volunteer Group|Soviet Union]] and the [[American Volunteer Group|United States]]. After the [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|Japanese attacks on Malaya]] and [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the war merged with other conflicts of [[World War II]] as a major sector known as the [[China Burma India Theater]]. Some scholars consider the start of the full-scale Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 to have been the beginning of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=John|last1=Ferris|first2=Evan|last2=Mawdsley|title=The Cambridge History of the Second World War, Volume I: Fighting the War|location=[[Cambridge]]|language=English|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2015|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Förster|Gessler|2005|p=64}} The Second Sino-Japanese War was the largest Asian war in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bix |first=Herbert P. |title=The Showa Emperor's 'Monologue' and the Problem of War Responsibility |journal=Journal of Japanese Studies |volume=18 |issue=2 |year=1992 |pages=295–363 |doi=10.2307/132824 |jstor=132824 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It accounted for the majority of civilian and military [[World War II casualties|casualties]] in the [[Pacific War]], with between 10 and 25 million Chinese civilians and over 4 million Chinese and Japanese military personnel missing or dying from war-related violence, famine, and other causes. The war has been called "the Asian [[The Holocaust|holocaust]]."{{sfnb|HsiungLevine|1992|p = [https://www.google.com/books/edition/China_s_Bitter_Victory_War_with_Japan_19/LY4YDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=Holocaust xi]}}

The war was the result of a decades-long [[Imperialism#Japan|Japanese imperialist]] policy to expand its influence politically and militarily in order to secure access to raw material reserves, food, and labor. The period after [[World War I]] brought about increasing stress on the Japanese polity. Leftists sought universal suffrage and greater rights for workers. Increasing textile production from Chinese mills was adversely affecting Japanese production and the [[Great Depression]] brought about a large slowdown in exports. All of this contributed to militant [[nationalism]], culminating in the rise to power of a militarist faction. This faction was led at its height by the [[Hideki Tojo]] cabinet of the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]] under edict from Emperor [[Hirohito]]. In 1931, the [[Mukden Incident]] helped spark the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]].

From 1931 to 1937, China and Japan continued to skirmish in small, localized engagements, so-called "incidents".

Following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Japanese scored major victories, capturing [[Battle of Beiping–Tianjin|Beijing]], [[Battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]] and the Chinese capital of [[Battle of Nanjing|Nanjing]] in 1937, which resulted in the [[Massacre of Nanjing|Rape of Nanjing]]. After failing to stop the Japanese in the [[Battle of Wuhan]], the Chinese central government was relocated to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking) in the Chinese interior. By 1939, after Chinese victories in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|Changsha]] and [[Battle of South Guangxi|Guangxi]], and with Japan's lines of communications stretched deep into the Chinese interior, the war reached a stalemate. The Japanese were also unable to defeat the Chinese communist forces in [[Shaanxi]], who waged a campaign of sabotage and guerrilla warfare against the invaders. While Japan ruled the large cities, they lacked sufficient manpower to control China's vast countryside. In November 1939, Chinese nationalist forces [[1939–40 Winter Offensive|launched a large scale winter offensive]], while in August 1940, Chinese communist forces [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|launched a counteroffensive]] in central China. The United States strongly supported China. It began supplying military and financial aid, and cut off Japan's oil exports.

In December 1941, the United States declared war on Japan and increased its flow of aid to China. With Burma cut off it airlifted material over [[the Hump|the Himalayas]]. In 1944, Japan launched the invasion, [[Operation Ichi-Go]], that conquered [[Henan]] and [[Changsha]]. However, this failed to bring about the surrender of Chinese forces. In 1945, the [[Chinese Expeditionary Force]] resumed [[Battle of Northern Burma and Western Yunnan|its advance in Burma]] and completed the [[Ledo Road]] linking India to China. At the same time, China launched large counteroffensives in South China and [[Battle of West Hunan|retook West Hunan]] [[Second Guangxi Campaign|and Guangxi]]. Japan formally surrendered on September 2, 1945. China regained all territories lost to Japan.

In China, the war is most commonly known as the "War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression" ({{zh| t=抗日戰爭| s=抗日战争}}), and shortened to the "Resistance against Japanese Aggression" ({{zh|抗日}}) or the "War of Resistance" ({{zh| s=抗战| t=抗戰|links=no}}). It was also called the "Eight Years' War of Resistance" ({{zh| s=八年抗战| t=八年抗戰|links=no}}), but in 2017 the Chinese Ministry of Education issued a directive stating that textbooks were to refer to the war as the "Fourteen Years' War of Resistance" ({{zh|s=十四年抗战|t=十四年抗戰|links=no}}), reflecting a focus on the broader conflict with Japan going back to 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/local/2017-01/10/c_1120280662.htm|title=2017年春季中小学教材全面落实"十四年抗战"概念-新华网|website=news.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as part of the "Global Anti-Fascist War", which is how World War II is perceived by the Communist Party of China and the PRC government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929143324/http://www.news.cn/english/special/jnkzsl/index.htm|title=Commemoration of 70th Anniversary of World Anti-Fascist War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, nowadays, the name "Japan–China War" ({{lang-ja|日中戦爭|translit=Nitchū Sensō}}) is most commonly used because of its perceived objectivity. When the invasion of [[China proper]] began in earnest in July 1937 near [[Beijing]], the [[Empire of Japan|government of Japan]] used "The North China Incident" ({{lang-ja|北支事變/華北事變|translit=Hokushi Jihen/Kahoku Jihen|links=no}}), and with the outbreak of the [[Battle of Shanghai]] the following month, it was changed to "The China Incident" ({{lang-ja|支那事變|translit=[[Shina (word)|Shina]] Jihen|links=no}}).

The word "incident" ({{lang-ja|事變|translit=jihen|links=no}}) was used by Japan, as neither country had made a formal [[declaration of war]]. From the Japanese perspective was that localizing these conflicts was beneficial in preventing intervention from other nations, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States, which were its primary source of petroleum and steel respectively. A formal expression of these conflicts would potentially lead to American embargo in accordance with the [[Neutrality Acts of the 1930s]].&lt;ref name=en&gt;Jerald A. Combs. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5215/is_2002/ai_n19132406/pg_7 Embargoes and Sanctions]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}. ''Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, due to China's fractured political status, Japan often claimed that China was no longer a recognizable political entity on which war could be declared.&lt;ref&gt;Rea, George Bronson. ''The Case for Manchoukuo''. New York: D. Appleton-Century Company, 1935. Pp 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other names===
In [[Propaganda in Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II|Japanese propaganda]], the invasion of China became a crusade ({{lang-ja|聖戦|translit=seisen|links=no}}), the first step of the "eight corners of the world under one roof" slogan ({{lang-ja|八紘一宇|translit=[[Hakkō ichiu]]|links=no}}). In 1940, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Fumimaro Konoe]] launched the [[Taisei Yokusankai]]. When both sides formally declared war in December 1941, the name was replaced by "[[Pacific War|Greater East Asia War]]" ({{lang-ja|大東亞戰爭|translit=Daitōa Sensō|links=no}}).

Although the Japanese government still uses the term "China Incident" in formal documents,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Linebarger|first=Paul M. A.|date=May 1941|title=The Status of the China Incident|jstor=1022596|journal=American Academy of Political and Social Science|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|volume=215|pages=36–43|doi=10.1177/000271624121500106}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word ''[[Shina (word)|Shina]]'' is considered derogatory by China and therefore the media in Japan often paraphrase with other expressions like "The Japan–China Incident" ({{lang-ja|日華事變/日支事變|translit=Nikka Jiken/Nisshi Jiken|links=no}}), which were used by media as early as the 1930s.

The name "Second Sino-Japanese War" is not commonly used in Japan as the war it fought with the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1894 is called the Qing-Japanese War ({{lang-ja|日清戦争|translit=Nisshin–Sensō|links=no}}) rather than the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].

==Historical background==
The origins of the Second Sino-Japanese War can be traced back to the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–1895, in which China, then under the rule of the [[Qing dynasty]], was defeated by Japan, forced to cede [[Taiwan]] to Japan, and recognize the full and complete independence of [[Korea]] in the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]; Japan also annexed the [[Diaoyudao]]/[[Senkaku Islands]] in early 1895 as a result of its victory at the end of the war (Japan claims the islands were uninhabited in 1895).&lt;ref name="Economist-2012-12-empty-space"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/christmas/21568696-behind-row-over-bunch-pacific-rocks-lies-sad-magical-history-okinawa-narrative |title=The Senkaku or Diaoyu Islands: Narrative of an empty space |journal=[[The Economist]] |date=December 22, 2012 |issue=Christmas Specials 2012 |publisher=[[Economist Group]] |location=[[London]] |issn=0013-0613 |accessdate=February 26, 2014 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226002234/http://www.economist.com/news/christmas/21568696-behind-row-over-bunch-pacific-rocks-lies-sad-magical-history-okinawa-narrative |archivedate=February 26, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/joyman-lee/senkakudiaoyu-islands-conflict|title=Senkaku/Diaoyu: Islands of Conflict|work=History Today|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11341139|title=How uninhabited islands soured China-Japan ties – BBC News|work=bbc.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qing dynasty was on the brink of collapse due to internal revolts and foreign [[imperialism]], while Japan had emerged as a [[great power]] through its effective measures of [[modernization]].{{sfn|Wilson|page=5}}

===Republic of China===
The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] was founded in 1912, following the [[Xinhai Revolution]] which overthrew the last imperial dynasty of China, the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). However, central authority disintegrated and the Republic's authority succumbed to that of [[Warlord Era|regional warlords]], mostly from the former [[Beiyang Army]]. Unifying the nation and repelling imperialism seemed a very remote possibility.{{sfn|Wilson|page=4}} Some warlords even aligned themselves with various foreign powers in their battles with each other. For example, the warlord [[Zhang Zuolin]] of [[Manchuria]] from the [[Fengtian clique]] openly cooperated with the Japanese for military and economic assistance.&lt;ref name="Foreign News: Revenge?-TIME-MAGAZINE"&gt;{{Cite news

===Twenty-One Demands===
In 1915, Japan issued the [[Twenty-One Demands]] to extort further political and commercial privilege from China, which was accepted by [[Yuan Shikai]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, Edwin P., Japan's War: The Great Pacific Conflict, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[World War I]], Japan acquired the [[German Empire]]'s [[sphere of influence]] in [[Shandong]] province,&lt;ref&gt;Palmer and Colton, A History of Modern World, p. 725&lt;/ref&gt; leading to nationwide anti-Japanese [[May Fourth Movement|protests and mass demonstrations]] in China. Under the [[Beiyang Government|Beiyang government]], China remained fragmented and was unable to resist foreign incursions.{{sfn|Taylor|page=33}} For the purpose of unifying China and defeating the regional warlords, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, alternatively known as the Chinese Nationalist Party) in [[Guangzhou]] launched the [[Northern Expedition]] from 1926 to 1928 with limited assistance from the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Taylor|page=57}}

===Jinan incident===
{{Main|Jinan incident}}

The [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA) formed by the KMT swept through southern and central China until it was checked in Shandong, where confrontations with the Japanese garrison escalated into armed conflict. The conflicts were collectively known as the [[Jinan incident]] of 1928, during which time the Japanese military killed several Chinese officials and fired artillery shells into Jinan. Between 2,000 and 11,000 Chinese and Japanese civilians were believed to have been killed during these conflicts. Relations between the Chinese Nationalist government and Japan severely worsened as a result of the Jinan incident.{{sfn|Taylor|page=79}}{{sfn|Taylor|page=82}}

===Reunification of China (1928)===
{{Main|Chinese reunification (1928)}}

As the National Revolutionary Army approached Beijing, Zhang Zuolin decided to retreat back to Manchuria, before he was [[Huanggutun Incident|assassinated]] by the Kwantung Army in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Boorman, Biographical Dictionary, vol. 1, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Zhang Xueliang]], took over as the leader of the Fengtian clique in Manchuria. Later in the same year, Zhang decided to [[Chinese reunification (1928)|declare his allegiance]] to the Nationalist government in Nanjing under [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and consequently, China was nominally reunified under one government.{{sfn|Taylor|page=83}}

===1929 Sino-Soviet war===
{{Main|Sino-Soviet conflict (1929)}}

The July–November 1929 conflict over the [[Chinese Eastern Railroad]] (CER) further increased the tensions in the Northeast that led to the Mukden Incident and eventually the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Soviet [[Red Army]] victory over [[Zhang Xueliang]]'s forces not only reasserted Soviet control over the CER in Manchuria but revealed Chinese military weaknesses that Japanese Kwantung Army officers were quick to note.&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. Walker, ''The 1929 Sino-Soviet War: The War Nobody Knew'' (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2017), p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Red Army performance also stunned the Japanese. Manchuria was central to Japan's East Asia policy. Both the 1921 and 1927 Imperial Eastern Region Conferences reconfirmed Japan's commitment to be the dominant power in the Northeast. The 1929 Red Army victory shook that policy to the core and reopened the Manchurian problem. By 1930, the Kwantung Army realized they faced a Red Army that was only growing stronger. The time to act was drawing near and Japanese plans to conquer the Northeast were accelerated.&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. Walker, ''The 1929 Sino-Soviet War: The War Nobody Knew'' (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2017), pp. 290–291.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist Party of China===
In 1930, the [[Central Plains War]] broke out across China, involving regional commanders who had fought in alliance with the Kuomintang during the Northern Expedition, and the Nanjing government under Chiang. The [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) previously fought openly against the Nanjing government after the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]], and they continued to expand during this civil war. The Kuomintang government in Nanjing decided to focus their efforts on suppressing the Chinese Communists through the [[Encirclement Campaigns]], following the policy of "first internal pacification, then external resistance" ({{zh|c=攘外必先安內|links=no}}).

==Prelude: invasion of Manchuria and Northern China==
{{anchor|occupation}}
[[File:Mukden 1931 japan shenyang.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese troops entering [[Shenyang]] during the [[Mukden Incident]]]]

The internecine warfare in China provided excellent opportunities for Japan, which saw Manchuria as a limitless supply of raw materials, a market for its manufactured goods (now excluded from the markets of many Western countries as a result of [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era [[tariff]]s), and a protective [[buffer state]] against the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Siberia]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japan invaded Manchuria]] outright after the [[Mukden Incident]] in September 1931. Japan charged that its rights in Manchuria, which had been established as a result of its victory at the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], had been systematically violated and there were "more than 120 cases of infringement of rights and interests, interference with business, boycott of Japanese goods, unreasonable taxation, detention of individuals, confiscation of properties, eviction, demand for cessation of business, assault and battery, and the oppression of Korean residents".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibiblio.org/pha/monos/144/144chap1.html POLITICAL STRATEGY PRIOR TO OUTBREAK OF WAR PART I] Japanese monograph No. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

After five months of fighting, Japan established the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932, and installed the last [[Emperor of China]], [[Puyi]], as its puppet ruler. Militarily too weak to challenge Japan directly, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. The League's investigation led to the publication of the [[Lytton Report]], condemning Japan for its incursion into Manchuria, causing Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations. No country took action against Japan beyond tepid censure.

Incessant fighting followed the Mukden Incident. In 1932, Chinese and Japanese troops fought the [[January 28 Incident]] battle. This resulted in the [[demilitarization]] of [[Shanghai]], which forbade the Chinese from deploying troops in their own city. In Manchukuo there was an [[Pacification of Manchukuo|ongoing campaign]] to defeat the [[Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies]] that arose from widespread outrage over the policy of non-resistance to Japan.
[[File:Dadao map 1939.svg|thumb|260px|Japanese Empire's [[List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|territorial expansion]]]]
In 1933, the Japanese [[Defense of the Great Wall|attacked the Great Wall]] region. The [[Tanggu Truce]] established in its aftermath, gave Japan control of [[Rehe Province|Jehol]] province as well as a demilitarized zone between the Great Wall and Beiping-Tianjin region. Japan aimed to create another buffer zone between Manchukuo and the Chinese Nationalist government in [[Nanjing]].

Japan increasingly exploited China's internal conflicts to reduce the strength of its fractious opponents. Even years after the [[Northern Expedition]], the political power of the Nationalist government was limited to just the area of the [[Yangtze River Delta]]. Other sections of China were essentially in the hands of local Chinese warlords. Japan sought various [[Hanjian|Chinese collaborators]] and helped them establish governments friendly to Japan. This policy was called the ''Specialization'' of [[North China]] ({{zh|c=華北特殊化|p=huáběitèshūhùa|links=no}}), more commonly known as the North China Autonomous Movement. The northern provinces affected by this policy were [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], [[Suiyuan]], [[Hebei]], [[Shanxi]], and [[Shandong]].

This Japanese policy was most effective in the area of what is now [[Inner Mongolia]] and Hebei. In 1935, under Japanese pressure, China signed the [[He–Umezu Agreement]], which forbade the KMT from conducting party operations in Hebei. In the same year, the [[Chin–Doihara Agreement]] was signed expelling the KMT from Chahar. Thus, by the end of 1935 the Chinese government had essentially abandoned northern China. In its place, the Japanese-backed [[East Hebei Autonomous Council]] and the [[Hebei–Chahar Political Council]] were established. There in the empty space of Chahar the [[Mengjiang|Mongol Military Government]] was formed on May 12, 1936. Japan provided all the necessary military and economic aid. Afterwards Chinese volunteer forces continued to resist Japanese aggression [[Pacification of Manchukuo|in Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933–1936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].

==Course of the war==

===1937: Full-scale invasion of China===
[[File:Jiangjieshi-declare.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] announced the [[Kuomintang]] policy of resistance against Japan at [[Lushan District|Lushan]] on July 10, 1937, three days after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]].]]

On the night of July 7, 1937, Chinese and Japanese troops exchanged fire in the vicinity of the Marco Polo (or Lugou) Bridge, a crucial access-route to [[Beiping]]. What began as confused, sporadic skirmishing soon escalated into a [[Battle of Beiping–Tianjin|full-scale battle]] in which Beiping and its port city of Tianjin fell to Japanese forces (July–August 1937). On July 29, some 5,000 troops of the 1st and 2nd Corps of the East Hopei Army mutinied, turning against the Japanese garrison. In addition to Japanese military personnel, some 260 civilians living in Tongzhou in accordance with the [[Boxer Protocol]] of 1901, were killed in the uprising (predominantly Japanese including the police force and also some ethnic Koreans). The Chinese then set fire to and destroyed much of the city. Only around 60 Japanese civilians survived, who provided both journalists and later historians with firsthand witness accounts. As a result of the violence of the mutiny against Japanese civilians, the [[Tungchow mutiny]] strongly shook public opinion within Japan.

===Battle of Shanghai===
{{Main|Battle of Shanghai}}

[[File:Shanghai1937IJA landing.jpg|thumb|Japanese landing near Shanghai, November 1937]]

The [[Imperial General Headquarters]] (GHQ) in Tokyo, content with the gains acquired in northern China following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, initially showed reluctance to escalate the conflict into full-scale war. The KMT, however, determined that the "breaking point" of Japanese aggression had been reached. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] quickly mobilized the central government's army and [[Development of Chinese Nationalist air force (1937–1945)|air force]], placed them under his direct command, and laid siege to the Japanese area of [[Shanghai International Settlement]], where 30,000 Japanese civilians lived with 30,000 troops on August 12, 1937.

[[File:Shanghai1937KMT machine gun nest.jpg|thumb|left|An NRA soldiers' machine gun nest in Shanghai]]

On August 13, 1937, [[Kuomintang]] soldiers and warplanes attacked [[Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces|Japanese Marine]] positions in Shanghai, leading to the [[Battle of Shanghai]]. On August 14, Kuomintang planes accidentally bombed the [[Shanghai International Settlement]], which led to more than 3,000 civilian deaths.&lt;ref name=Wakeman280281&gt;{{cite book| author = Frederic E.

[[File:Shanghai1937IJA ruins.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese troops in the ruins of Shanghai]]

The skies of China had become a testing zone for advanced [[biplane]] and new-generation [[monoplane]] combat-aircraft designs. The introduction of the advanced [[Mitsubishi A5M|A5M]] "Claude" fighters into the Shanghai-Nanjing theater of operations, beginning on September 18, 1937, helped the Japanese achieve a certain level of [[Air superiority fighter|air superiority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail-page-2.asp?aircraft_id=619|title=Mitsubishi A5M (Claude) – Development and Operational History, Performance Specifications and Picture Gallery|work=militaryfactory.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Januszewski|first=Tadeusz|title=Mitsubishi A5M Claude (Yellow Series)|year=2013|publisher= STRATUS|location=P.O.

The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) ultimately committed over 200,000 troops, along with numerous naval vessels and aircraft, to capture the city. After more than three months of intense fighting, their casualties far exceeded initial expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Fu Jing-hui, An Introduction of Chinese and Foreign History of War, 2003, pp. 109–111&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, the Japanese Army captured Dachang, an important strong-point within Shanghai, and on November 5, additional reinforcements of Japan landed from Hangzhou Bay. Finally, on November 9, the NRA began a general retreat.

===Battle of Nanjing and Nanjing Massacre===
{{Main|Battle of Nanjing|Nanjing Massacre}}
[[File:Soviet embassy burned down.PNG|thumb|Soviet embassy in Nanjing is being burned down by arson on January 1, 1938.]]
[[File:Photo 07 (The "Shame" Album).jpg|thumb|upright|A Chinese POW about to be beheaded by a Japanese officer with a ''[[shin gunto]]'']]

Building on the hard-won victory in Shanghai, the IJA [[Battle of Nanjing|captured the KMT capital city]] of [[Nanjing]] (December 1937) and [[Battle of Xinkou|Northern Shanxi]] (September–November 1937). These campaigns involved approximately 350,000 Japanese soldiers, and considerably more Chinese.

Historians estimate that between December 13, 1937, and late January 1938, Japanese forces killed or wounded an estimated 40,000 to 300,000 Chinese (mostly civilians) in the "[[Nanjing Massacre]]" (also known as the "Rape of Nanjing"), after [[Battle of Nanjing|its fall]]. However, historian David Askew of Japan’s [[Ritsumeikan University]] argued that less than 32,000 civilians and soldiers died and no more than 250,000 civilians could have remained in Nanjing, the vast majority of whom had took refuge in the [[Nanjing Safety Zone]], a foreign established safety zone lead by [[John Rabe]] who was a [[Nazi party]] official.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8t6VLxjTZ2IC&amp;pg=PP285#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; More than 75% of Nanjing's civilian population had already fled Nanjing before the battle commenced while most of the remainder took refuge in [[Nanking Safety Zone]], leaving only destitute pariah classes like [[Tanka people]] and Duo people behind. 

In 2005, a history textbook prepared by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform which had been approved by the government in 2001, sparked huge outcry and protests in China and Korea. It referred to the Nanjing Massacre and other atrocities such as the [[Manila massacre]] as an "incident", glossed over the issue of comfort women, and made only brief references to the death of Chinese soldiers and civilians in Nanjing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21226068|title=What Japanese history lessons leave out|last=Oi|first=Mariko|date=14 Mar 2013|website=BBC|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the 2005 version of a junior high school textbook titled ''New History Textbook'' found that there is no mention of the "Nanjing Massacre" or the "Nanjing Incident".

===1938===
At the start of 1938, the leadership in Tokyo still hoped to limit the scope of the conflict to occupy areas around Shanghai, Nanjing and most of northern China. They thought this would preserve strength for an anticipated showdown with the Soviet Union, but by now the Japanese government and GHQ had effectively lost control of the Japanese army in China. With many victories achieved, Japanese field generals [[Battle of Xuzhou|escalated the war in Jiangsu]] in an attempt to wipe out Chinese resistance, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]] (March–April 1938). Afterwards the IJA changed its strategy and deployed almost all of its existing armies in China to attack the city of [[Wuhan]], which had become the political, economic and military center of rump China, in hopes of destroying the fighting strength of the [[National Revolutionary Army|NRA]] and of forcing the KMT government to negotiate for peace.{{sfn|Huang|page=168}} On June 6, they captured Kaifeng, the capital of Henan, and threatened to take Zhengzhou, the junction of the Pinghan and Longhai railways. To prevent Japanese advances in western and southern China, Chiang Kai-shek, at the suggestion of Chen Guofu, ordered the opening of the dikes on the Yellow River near Zhengzhou. The original plan was to destroy the dike in Zhaokou, but due to difficulties in that place, the Huayuankou dike on the south bank was destroyed on June 5 and June 7 by excavation, with flood waters over eastern Henan, central Anhui, and north central Jiangsu. The floods covered and destroyed thousands of square kilometers of agricultural land and displaced the mouth of the Yellow River hundreds of miles to the south. Thousands of villages were flooded or destroyed and several million villagers were force to evacuate from their homes. 400,000 people including Japanese soldiers drowned and an additional 10 million became refugees. Rivers were filled with corpses as Tanka boat dwellers drowned from boat capsize. Damage to plantations also affected the population which generated later hunger. Despite this, the Japanese [[Battle of Wuhan|captured Wuhan]] on October 27, 1938, forcing the KMT to retreat to [[Chongqing]] (Chungking), but Chiang Kai-shek still refused to negotiate, saying he would only consider talks if Japan agreed to withdraw to the pre-1937 borders. In 1937, the Japanese Imperial Army quickly marched into the heart of Chinese territory. 

With Japanese casualties and costs mounting, the Imperial General Headquarters attempted to break Chinese resistance by ordering the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service|air branches of their navy]] and [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service|army]] to launch the war's first [[Strategic bombing during World War II#Japanese bombing|massive air raids]] on civilian targets. Japanese raiders hit the Kuomintang's newly established [[Bombing of Chongqing|provisional capital of Chongqing]] and most other major cities in unoccupied China, leaving many people either dead, injured, or homeless.

===1939–40: Chinese counterattack and stalemate===
[[File:Second Sino-Japanese War WW2.png|thumb|Map showing the extent of Japanese occupation in 1941 (in red)]]
[[File:Situation at the End of World War Two.PNG|thumb|Japanese occupation (red) of eastern China near the end of the war, and Communist guerrilla bases (striped)]]

From the beginning of 1939, the war entered a new phase with the unprecedented defeat of the Japanese at [[Battle of Suixian–Zaoyang]], [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1st Battle of Changsha]], [[Battle of South Guangxi]] and [[Battle of Zaoyi]]. These outcomes encouraged the Chinese to launch their first large-scale [[1939–1940 Winter Offensive|counter-offensive]] against the IJA in early 1940; however, due to its low military-industrial capacity and limited experience in [[modern warfare]], this offensive was defeated. Afterwards Chiang could not risk any more all-out offensive campaigns given the poorly trained, under-equipped, and disorganized state of his armies and opposition to his leadership both within the Kuomintang and in China in general. He had lost a substantial portion of his best trained and equipped troops in the [[Battle of Shanghai]] and was at times at the mercy of his generals, who maintained a high degree of autonomy from the central KMT government.

During the offensive, Hui forces in Suiyuan under generals [[Ma Hongbin]] and [[Ma Buqing]] routed the Imperial Japanese Army and their puppet Inner Mongol forces and prevented the planned Japanese advance into northwest China. Ma Hongbin's father [[Ma Fulu]] had fought against Japanese in the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. General [[Ma Biao (general)|Ma Biao]] led Hui, Salar and Dongxiang cavalry to defeat the Japanese at the [[Battle of Huaiyang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zk.ccoo.cn/news/local/3889814.html 8000骑兵战士战死抗日沙场，可歌可泣_周口热点资讯&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022054615/http://www.zk.ccoo.cn/news/local/3889814.html |date=October 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qhmhmlc.blog.163.com/blog/static/294989642015824284687?suggestedreading|title=青海八千人骑兵师东进抗日 – 昆仑玉的日志 – 网易博客|last=qhmhmlc,昆仑玉|work=163.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112172144/http://qhmhmlc.blog.163.com/blog/static/294989642015824284687?suggestedreading|archive-date=January 12, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qh.people.com.cn/n/2015/0831/c181467-26189312.html|title=冈村宁次为什么在作战记录中写下"恶战马彪"--青海频道--人民网|last=L_104241|work=people.com.cn|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yododo.com/area/photo/013EE3A4D9ED097BFF8080813EE2DC53|title=马彪（1885——... - 南昌照片 by 山中老人家|author=|date=|website=www.yododo.com|access-date=October 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112160043/http://www.yododo.com/area/photo/013EE3A4D9ED097BFF8080813EE2DC53|archive-date=January 12, 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.qulishi.com/news/201411/20135.html 马步芳军队抗战纪实：抗战中的马步芳和马家军！ -趣历史&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimwww.com/html/2014/lishi_0421/23732.html|title=为抗击日寇和建立新中国浴血奋斗的中国穆斯林 – 历史 – 穆斯林在线-打造全球最大的伊斯兰中文门户网站(muslimwww)|work=muslimwww.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qulishi.com/news/201411/20135.html|title=马步芳军队抗战纪实：抗战中的马步芳和马家军！- 趣历史|work=qulishi.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912090554/http://www.qulishi.com/news/201411/20135.html|archive-date=September 12, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinaislam.net.cn/cms/whyj/mmxm/zmrs/201412/14-7574.html 让日军闻风丧胆地回族抗日名将&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702131936/http://www.chinaislam.net.cn/cms/whyj/mmxm/zmrs/201412/14-7574.html |date=July 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimwww.com/html/2013/lishi_0411/13152.html|title=还原真实的西北群马之马步芳 骑八师中原抗日 – 历史 – 穆斯林在线-打造全球最大的伊斯兰中文门户网站(muslimwww)|work=muslimwww.com|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ma Biao fought against the Japanese in the Boxer Rebellion.

After 1940, the Japanese encountered tremendous difficulties in administering and garrisoning the seized territories, and tried to solve its occupation problems by implementing a strategy of creating friendly [[Puppet state|puppet governments]] favorable to Japanese interests in the territories conquered, most prominently the [[Nanjing Nationalist Government]] headed by former KMT premier [[Wang Jingwei]]. However, [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed by the Imperial Japanese Army, as well as Japanese refusal to delegate any real power, left the puppets very unpopular and largely ineffective. The only success the Japanese had was to recruit a large [[Collaborationist Chinese Army]] to maintain public security in the occupied areas.

===Japanese expansion===
[[File:1941 Type92 Combat Cars near Nanking.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Type 92 Heavy Armoured Car]]s near Nanjing, 1941]]

By 1941, Japan held most of the eastern coastal areas of China and Vietnam, but [[guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] fighting continued in these occupied areas. Japan had suffered high casualties from unexpectedly stubborn Chinese resistance, and neither side could make any swift progress in the manner of [[Nazi Germany]] in [[Battle of France|Western Europe]].

By 1943, Guangdong had experienced famine. As the situation worsened, [[New York City|New York]] Chinese compatriots received a letter stating that 600,000 people were killed in [[Siyi]] by starvation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4hdwAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese resistance strategy===
The basis of Chinese strategy before the entrance of the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] can be divided into two periods as follows:
* '''First Period''': July 7, 1937 ([[Marco Polo Bridge Incident|Battle of Lugou Bridge]])&amp;nbsp;– October 25, 1938 (end of the [[Battle of Wuhan]] with the fall of the city).
* '''Second Period''': October 25, 1938 (following the Fall of Wuhan)&amp;nbsp;– December 1941 (before the Allies' [[declaration of war]] on Japan).

====First period (July 1937 – October 1938)====

Unlike Japan, China was unprepared for [[total war]] and had little military-industrial strength, no [[Armoured warfare|mechanized divisions]], and few [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armoured forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Klemen |last=L |url=http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/china_armour.html |title=Chinese Nationalist Armour in World War II |date=1999–2000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941–1942 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321233313/http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/china_armour.html |archivedate=March 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until the mid-1930s, China had hoped that the [[League of Nations]] would provide countermeasures to Japan's aggression. In addition, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government was mired in a civil war against the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), as [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was quoted: "the Japanese are a disease of the skin, the Communists are a disease of the heart". The [[Second United Front]] between the KMT and CPC was never truly unified, as each side was preparing for a showdown with the other once the Japanese were driven out.

[[File:Taierzhuang.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese soldiers in [[Urban warfare|house-to-house]] fighting in the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]], March–April 1938]]

Even under these extremely unfavorable circumstances, Chiang realized that to win support from the United States and other foreign nations, China had to prove it was capable of fighting. Knowing a hasty retreat would discourage foreign aid, Chiang resolved to make a stand [[Battle of Shanghai|at Shanghai]], using the best of his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|German-trained divisions]] to defend China's largest and most [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] city from the Japanese. The battle lasted over three months, saw heavy casualties on both sides, and ended with a Chinese retreat towards Nanjing, but proved that China would not be easily defeated and showed its determination to the world. The battle became an enormous morale booster for the Chinese people, as it decisively refuted the Japanese boast that Japan could conquer Shanghai in three days and China in three months.

Afterwards, China began to adopt the [[Fabian strategy]] of "trading space for time" ({{zh|s=以空间换取时间|t=以空間換取時間|links=no}}). The Chinese army would put up fights to delay the Japanese advance to northern and eastern cities, allowing the [[home front]], with its professionals and key industries, to retreat west into [[Chongqing]]. As a result of Chinese troops' [[scorched earth]] strategies, [[dam]]s and [[levee]]s were intentionally sabotaged to [[1938 Yellow River flood|create massive flooding]], which caused thousands of deaths and many more to seek refuge.

====Second period (October 1938 – December 1941)====
[[File:Chinese soldiers 1939.jpg|thumb|National Revolutionary Army soldiers march to the [[Military front|front]] in 1939.]]

During this period, the main Chinese objective was to drag out the war for as long as possible in a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]], thereby exhausting Japanese resources while building up Chinese military capacity. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] called this strategy "winning by outlasting". The NRA adopted the concept of "magnetic warfare" to attract advancing Japanese troops to definite points where they were subjected to ambush, flanking attacks, and encirclements in major engagements. The most prominent example of this tactic was the successful defense of [[Changsha]] in [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1939]] (and again in [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|1941]]), in which heavy casualties were inflicted on the IJA.

Local Chinese [[Resistance movement|resistance forces]], organized separately by both the communists and KMT, continued their resistance in occupied areas to pester the enemy and make their administration over the vast land area of China difficult. In 1940, the [[Eighth Route Army|Chinese Red Army]] launched a [[Hundred Regiments Offensive|major offensive]] in north China, destroying railways and a major coal mine. These constant harassment and sabotage operations deeply frustrated the Imperial Japanese Army and led them to employ the "[[Three Alls Policy]]" (kill all, loot all, burn all) ({{lang|hni|三光政策}}, [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: ''Sānguāng Zhèngcè'', Japanese [[Onyomi|On]]: ''Sankō Seisaku''). It was during this period that the bulk of [[Japanese war crimes]] were committed.

By 1941, Japan had occupied much of north and coastal China, but the KMT central government and military had retreated to the western interior to continue their resistance, while the Chinese communists remained in control of base areas in [[Shaanxi]]. In the occupied areas, Japanese control was mainly limited to railroads and major cities ("points and lines"). They did not have a major military or administrative presence in the vast Chinese countryside, where Chinese guerrillas roamed freely.

The United States strongly supported China starting in 1937 and warned Japan to get out.&lt;ref&gt;John McVickar Haight,  "Franklin D. Roosevelt and a Naval Quarantine of Japan." ''Pacific Historical Review'' 40.2 (1971): 203-226 [https://phr.ucpress.edu/content/ucpphr/40/2/203.full.pdf online]. &lt;/ref&gt;  American financial and military aid began to flow.&lt;ref&gt;Tai-Chun Kuo,  "A Strong Diplomat in a Weak Polity: TV Soong and wartime US–China relations, 1940–1943."

===Relationship between the Nationalists and Communists===
[[File:Zhu De with NRA Emblem.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eighth Route Army]] Commander [[Zhu De]] with KMT Blue Sky White Sun Emblem cap]]

After the [[Mukden Incident]] in 1931, Chinese public opinion was strongly critical of Manchuria's leader, the "young marshal" [[Zhang Xueliang]], for his nonresistance to the Japanese invasion, even though the Kuomintang central government was also responsible for this policy, giving Zhang an order to "improvise" while not offering support. After losing Manchuria to the Japanese, Zhang and his [[Fengtian clique|Northeast Army]] were given the duty of suppressing [[Chinese Red Army|the Red Army]] of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CPC) in [[Shaanxi]] after their [[Long March]]. This resulted in great casualties for his Northeast Army, which received no support in manpower or weaponry from Chiang Kai-shek.

On December 12, 1936, a deeply disgruntled Zhang Xueliang [[Xi'an Incident|kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek]] in [[Xi'an]], hoping to force an end to the conflict between KMT and CPC. To secure the release of Chiang, the KMT agreed to a temporary end to the [[Chinese Civil War]] and, on December 24, the creation of a [[Second United Front (China)|United Front]] between the CPC and KMT against Japan. The alliance having salutary effects for the beleaguered CPC, they agreed to form the [[New Fourth Army]] and the [[8th Route Army]] and place them under the nominal control of the NRA. In agreement with KMT [[Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region]] and [[Shanxi]]-[[Chahar Province|Chahar]]-[[Hebei]] Border Region were created. They were controlled by CCP. The CPC's Red Army fought alongside KMT forces during the [[Battle of Taiyuan]], and the high point of their cooperation came in 1938 during the [[Battle of Wuhan]].

Despite Japan's steady territorial gains in northern China, the coastal regions, and the rich [[Yangtze River]] Valley in central China, the distrust between the two antagonists was scarcely veiled. The uneasy alliance began to break down by late 1938, partially due to the Communists' aggressive efforts to expand their military strength by absorbing Chinese guerrilla forces behind Japanese lines. Chinese militia who refused to switch their allegiance were often labelled "collaborators" and attacked by CPC forces. For example, the Red Army led by [[He Long]] attacked and wiped out a brigade of Chinese militia led by Zhang Yin-wu in [[Hebei]] in June 1939.{{sfn|Huang|page=259}} Starting in 1940, open conflict between Nationalists and Communists became more frequent in the occupied areas outside of Japanese control, culminating in the [[New Fourth Army Incident]] in January 1941.

Afterwards, the Second United Front completely broke down and Chinese Communists leader [[Mao Zedong]] outlined the preliminary plan for the CPC's eventual seizure of power from Chiang Kai-shek. Mao began his final push for consolidation of CPC power under his authority, and his teachings became the central tenets of the CPC doctrine that came to be formalized as "[[Mao Zedong Thought]]". The communists also began to focus most of their energy on building up their sphere of influence wherever opportunities were presented, mainly through rural mass organizations, administrative, [[Land ownership|land]] and [[Taxation|tax]] reform measures favoring poor [[peasant]]s; while the Nationalists attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence by military blockade of areas controlled by CPC and fighting the Japanese at the same time.&lt;ref name=CRISIS-TIME-MAGAZINE&gt;{{Cite news

Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the United States declared war against Japan, and within days China joined the Allies in formal declaration of war against Japan, Germany and Italy.&lt;ref name="China Declares War"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=December 15, 1941 |title=China's Declaration of War Against Japan, Germany and Italy |journal=Contemporary China |publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org |volume=1 |issue=15 |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/chinawar.html |accessdate=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Western Allies entered the war against Japan, the Sino-Japanese War would become part of a greater conflict, the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre]] of [[World War II]]. Almost immediately, Chinese troops achieved another decisive victory in the [[Battle of Changsha (1942)|Battle of Changsha]], which earned the Chinese government much prestige from the Western Allies. President Franklin D. Roosevelt referred to the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union and China as the world's "[[Four Policemen]]", elevating the international status of China to an unprecedented height after the [[century of humiliation]] at the hands of various imperialist powers.

Knowledge of Japanese naval movements in the Pacific was provided to the American Navy by the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization]] (SACO) which was run by the Chinese intelligence head [[Dai Li]].&lt;ref name="Wakeman2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederic E.

Chiang Kai-shek continued to receive supplies from the United States. However, in contrast to the Arctic supply route to the Soviet Union which stayed open through most of the war, sea routes to China and the [[Yunnan–Vietnam Railway]] had been closed since 1940. Therefore, between the [[Japanese conquest of Burma|closing of the Burma Road]] in 1942 and its re-opening as the [[Ledo Road]] in 1945, foreign aid was largely limited to what could be flown in over "[[The Hump]]". In Burma, on April 16, 1942, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the [[Battle of Yenangyaung]] and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Slim|first=William|title=Defeat into Victory|year=1956|publisher=Cassell|location=London|isbn=0-304-29114-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Doolittle Raid]], the Imperial Japanese Army conducted a massive sweep through [[Zhejiang]] and [[Jiangxi]] of China, now known as the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign]], with the goal of finding the surviving American airmen, applying retribution on the Chinese who aided them and destroying air bases.

Most of China's industry had already been captured or destroyed by Japan, and the Soviet Union refused to allow the United States to supply China through [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]] into [[Xinjiang]] as the Xinjiang warlord [[Sheng Shicai]] had turned [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet]] in 1942 with Chiang's approval. For these reasons, the Chinese government never had the supplies and equipment needed to mount major counter-offensives. Despite the severe shortage of matériel, in 1943, the Chinese were successful in repelling major Japanese offensives [[Battle of West Hubei|in Hubei]] and [[Battle of Changde|Changde]].

Chiang was named Allied commander-in-chief in the China theater in 1942. American general [[Joseph Stilwell]] served for a time as Chiang's chief of staff, while simultaneously commanding American forces in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India Theater]]. For many reasons, relations between Stilwell and Chiang soon broke down. Many historians (such as [[Barbara W. Tuchman]]) have suggested it was largely due to the corruption and inefficiency of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) government, while others (such as [[Ray Huang]] and [[Hans van de Ven]]) have depicted it as a more complicated situation. Stilwell had a strong desire to assume total control of Chinese troops and pursue an aggressive strategy, while Chiang preferred a patient and less expensive strategy of out-waiting the Japanese. Chiang continued to maintain a defensive posture despite Allied pleas to actively break the Japanese blockade, because China had already suffered tens of millions of war casualties and believed that Japan would eventually capitulate in the face of America's overwhelming industrial output. For these reasons the other Allies gradually began to lose confidence in the Chinese ability to conduct offensive operations from the Asian mainland, and instead concentrated their efforts against the Japanese in the [[Pacific Ocean Areas (command)|Pacific Ocean Areas]] and [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]], employing an [[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]] strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Van de Ven, "Stilwell in the Stocks: The Chinese Nationalists and the Allied Powers in the Second World War", ''Asian Affairs'' 34.3 (November 2003): 243–259.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cairo conference.jpg|thumb|left|Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Winston Churchill]] met at the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] in 1943 during World War II.]]

Long-standing differences in national interest and political stance among China, the United States, and the United Kingdom remained in place. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was reluctant to devote British troops, many of whom had been routed by the Japanese in earlier campaigns, to the reopening of the [[Burma Road]]; Stilwell, on the other hand, believed that reopening the road was vital, as all China's mainland ports were under Japanese control. The Allies' "[[Europe first|Europe First]]" policy did not sit well with Chiang, while the later British insistence that China send more and more troops to Indochina for use in the [[Burma Campaign]] was seen by Chiang as an attempt to use Chinese manpower to defend British colonial holdings. Chiang also believed that China should divert its crack army divisions from Burma to eastern China to defend the airbases of the American bombers that he hoped would defeat Japan through bombing, a strategy that American general [[Claire Lee Chennault]] supported but which Stilwell strongly opposed. In addition, Chiang voiced his support of [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] in a 1942 meeting with [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]], which further soured the relationship between China and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Huang|pages=299–300}}

American and Canadian-born Chinese were recruited to act as covert operatives in Japanese-occupied China (Canadian-born Chinese who had not been granted citizenship were trained by the British army). Employing their racial background as a disguise, their mandate was to blend in with local citizens and wage a campaign of sabotage. Activities focused on destruction of Japanese transportation of supplies (signaling bomber destruction of railroads, bridges).{{Sfn|MacLaren|pages=200–220}}

The British and Commonwealth forces had their operation in [[Mission 204]] which attempted to provide assistance to the Chinese Nationalist Army.{{Sfn|Stevens|page=70}} The first phase in 1942 under command of [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]] achieved very little, but lessons were learned and a second more successful phase, commenced in February 1943 under British Military command, was conducted before the Japanese [[Operation Ichi-Go]] offensive in 1944 compelled evacuation.{{Sfn|Stevens|page=73}}

The United States saw the Chinese theater as a means to tie up a large number of Japanese troops, as well as being a location for American airbases from which to strike the Japanese home islands. In 1944, with the Japanese position in the Pacific deteriorating rapidly, the IJA mobilized over 500,000 men and launched Operation Ichi-Go, their largest offensive of World War II, to attack the American airbases in China and link up the railway between Manchuria and Vietnam. This brought major cities in Hunan, Henan and Guangxi under Japanese occupation. The failure of Chinese forces to defend these areas encouraged Stilwell to attempt to gain overall command of the Chinese army, and his subsequent showdown with Chiang led to his replacement by Major General [[Albert Coady Wedemeyer]]. In 1944, China came off of several victories against Japan in Burma leading to overconfidence. Nationalist China also diverted soldiers to Xinjiang since 1942 to retake the province from the Soviet client [[Sheng Shicai]] whose puppet army was backed by the Soviet Red Army 8th Regiment in Hami, Xinjiang since the [[Soviet invasion of Xinjiang]] in 1934 when the Soviets occupied northern Xinjiang and the [[Islamic rebellion in Xinjiang]] in 1937 when the Soviets occupied southern Xinjiang as well placing all of Xinjiang under Sheng Shicai and Soviet Communist control. The fighting then escalated in early 1944 with the [[Ili Rebellion]] with Soviet backed Uyghur Communist rebels, causing China to fight enemies on two fronts with 120,000 Chinese soldiers fighting against the Ili rebellion. The aim of the Japanese Operation Ichigo was to destroy American airfields in southern China that threatened the Japanese home islands with bombing and to link railways in Beijing, Hankou and Canton cities from northern China in Beijing to southern China's coast on Canton. Japan was alarmed by American air raids against Japanese forces in Taiwan's [[Hsinchu]] airfield by American bombers based in southern China, correctly deducing that southern China could become the base of a major American bombing campaign against the Japanese home islands so Japan resolved to destroy and capture all airbases where American bombers operated from in Operation Ichigo. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the Republic of China authorities deliberately ignored and dismissed a tip passed on to the Chinese government in Chongqing by the French military that the French picked up in colonial French Indochina on the impending Japanese offensive to link the three cities. The Chinese military believed it to be a fake tip planted by Japan to mislead them since only 30,000 Japanese soldiers started the first maneuver of Operation Ichigo in northern China crossing the Yellow river so the Chinese assumed it would be a local operation in northern China only. Another major factor was that the battlefront between China and Japan was static and stabilized since 1940 and continued for four years that way until Operation Ichigo in 1944 so Chiang assumed that Japan would continue the same posture and remain behind the lines in pre-1940 occupied territories of North China only bolstering the puppet Chinese government of Wang Jingwei and exploiting resources there. The Japanese had indeed acted this way for most of the 1940s from 1940–1944, with the Japanese only making a few failed weak attempts to capture China's provisional capital in Chongqing on the Yangtze river which they quickly abandoned and gave up on before 1944. Japan also exhibited no intention before of linking the transcontinental Beijing Hankow Canton railways. China also was made confident by its three victories in a row defending Changsha against Japan at the [[Battle of Changsha (1939)]], [[Battle of Changsha (1941)]], and [[Battle of Changsha (1942)]]. China had also defeated Japan in the India-[[Burma campaign|Burma theater]] in Southeast Asia with [[X Force]] and [[Y Force]] and the Chinese  could not believe Japan had carelessly let information slip into French hands, believing Japan deliberately fed misinformation to the French to divert Chinese troops from India and Burma towards China. China believed the Burma theater to be far more important for Japan than southern China and that Japanese forces in southern China would continue to assume a defensive posture only. China believed the initial Japanese attack in Ichigo to be a localized feint and distraction in northern China so Chinese troops numbering 400,000 in North China deliberately withdrew without a fight when Japan attacked, assuming it was just another localized operation after which the Japanese would withdraw. This mistake led to the collapse of Chinese defensive lines as the Japanese soldiers which eventually numbered in the hundreds of thousands kept pressing the attack from northern China to central China to southern China's provinces as Chinese soldiers deliberately withdrew leading to confusion and collapse, except at the  [[Defense of Hengyang]] where 17,000 outnumbered Chinese soldiers held out against over 110,000 Japanese soldiers for months in the longest siege of the war inflicting 19,000-60,000 deaths on the Japanese. At Tushan in Guizhou province, the Nationalist government of China was forced to deploy five armies of the 8th war zone that they were using for the entire war up to Ichigo to contain the Communist Chinese to instead fight Japan. But at that point, dietary deficiencies of Japanese soldiers and increasing casualties suffered by Japan forced Japan to end Operation Ichigo in Guizhou causing the operation to cease. After Operation Ichigo, Chiang Kai-shek started a plan to withdraw Chinese troops from the Burma theatre against Japan in Southeast Asia for a counter offensive called "White Tower" and "Iceman" against Japanese soldiers in China in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hsiung |editor1-first=James C. |editor2-last=Levine |editor2-first=Steven I. |title=China's Bitter Victory: The War with Japan, 1937-1945 |date=1992 |publisher=M.E.

By the end of 1944 [[Chinese Army in India|Chinese troops]] under the command of [[Sun Li-jen]] attacking from India, and those under [[Wei Lihuang]] attacking from [[Yunnan]], joined forces in [[Mong-Yu]], successfully driving the Japanese out of North Burma and securing the [[Ledo Road]], China's vital supply artery.{{sfn|Huang|page=420}} In Spring 1945 the Chinese launched offensives that retook [[Battle of West Hunan|Hunan]] and [[Second Guangxi Campaign|Guangxi]].

After Germany and Japan signed the anti-communist [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], the Soviet Union hoped to keep China fighting, in order to deter a [[Kantokuen|Japanese invasion]] of [[Siberia]] and save itself from a [[two-front war]]. In September 1937, they signed the [[Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact]] and approved [[Operation Zet]], the formation of a secret [[Soviet Volunteer Group|Soviet volunteer air force]], in which Soviet technicians upgraded and ran some of China's transportation systems. [[Bomber]]s, [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], supplies and advisors arrived, including Soviet general [[Vasily Chuikov]], future victor in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. Prior to the Western Allies, the Soviets provided the most foreign aid to China: some $250 million in credits for munitions and other supplies. The Soviet Union defeated Japan in the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]] in May&amp;nbsp;– September 1939, leaving the Japanese reluctant to fight the Soviets again.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Varner, ''To the Banks of the Halha: The Nomohan Incident and the Northern Limits of the Japanese Empire'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1941, Soviet aid to China ended with the [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact]] and the beginning of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]]. This pact enabled the Soviet Union to avoid fighting against Germany and Japan at the same time. In August 1945, the Soviet Union annulled the neutrality pact with Japan and invaded Manchuria, Inner Mongolia, the Kuril Islands, and northern Korea. The Soviets also continued to support the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. In total, 3,665 Soviet advisors and pilots served in China,{{sfn|Taylor|page=156}} and 227 of them died fighting there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soldat.ru/doc/casualties/book/chapter4_4.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313141742/http://www.soldat.ru/doc/casualties/book/chapter4_4.html|date=March 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From December 1937, events such as the [[Panay incident|Japanese attack on USS ''Panay'']] and the [[Nanjing Massacre]] swung public opinion in the West sharply against Japan and increased their fear of Japanese expansion, which prompted the United States, the United Kingdom, and [[French Third Republic|France]] to provide loan assistance for war supply contracts to [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]]. Australia also prevented a Japanese government-owned company from taking over an iron mine in Australia, and banned [[iron ore]] exports in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.dfat.gov.au/info/historical/HistDocs.nsf/(LookupVolNoNumber)/3~221 |title=Memorandum by Mr J.

Japan freely bought weapons from U.S. companies, even as the U.S. Government barred the sale of weapons to Republican Spain. From 1937–1940, Japanese bombers were fueled with American oil and Japanese weapons were made out of American scrap iron. America supplied Japan with 54.4% of its war materials in 1937 when Japan invaded China, increasing to 56% in 1938.

Japan [[Invasion of French Indochina|invaded and occupied the northern part of French Indochina]] (present-day [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]]) in September 1940 to prevent China from receiving the 10,000 tons of materials delivered monthly by the Allies via the [[Haiphong–Yunnan Fou Railway]] line.

On June 22, 1941, [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany attacked the Soviet Union]]. In spite of non-aggression pacts or trade connections, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s assault threw the world into a frenzy of re-aligning political outlooks and strategic prospects.

On July 21, Japan occupied the southern part of French Indochina (southern Vietnam and Cambodia), contravening a 1940 "[[gentlemen's agreement]]" not to move into southern French Indochina. From bases in Cambodia and southern Vietnam, Japanese planes could attack Malaya, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies. As the Japanese occupation of northern French Indochina in 1940 had already cut off supplies from the West to China, the move into southern French Indochina was viewed as a direct threat to British and Dutch colonies. Many principal figures in the Japanese government and military (particularly the navy) were against the move, as they foresaw that it would invite retaliation from the West.

{{anchor|Oil embargo (Sino-Japanese War)}}
On July 24, 1941, Roosevelt requested Japan withdraw all its forces from Indochina. Two days later the US and the UK began an oil embargo; two days after that the Netherlands joined them. This was a decisive moment in the Second Sino-Japanese War. The loss of oil imports made it impossible for Japan to continue operations in China on a long-term basis. It set the stage for Japan to launch a series of military attacks against the Allies, including the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941.

[[File:Flying Tigers Bite Back.ogg|thumb|US Air Forces video: Flying Tigers Bite Back]]

In mid-1941, the United States government financed the creation of the [[American Volunteer Group]] (AVG), or [[Flying Tigers]], to replace the withdrawn Soviet volunteers and aircraft. Contrary to popular perception, the Flying Tigers did not enter actual combat until after the United States had declared war on Japan. Led by [[Claire Lee Chennault]], their early combat success of 300 kills against a loss of 12 of their newly introduced shark painted [[Curtiss P-40|P-40]] fighters heavily armed with [[M2 Browning|6X50 caliber machine guns]] and very fast diving speeds earned them wide recognition at a time when the Chinese Air Force and Allies in the Pacific and SE Asia were suffering heavy losses, and soon afterwards their "boom and zoom" high-speed hit-and-run [[Dissimilar air combat training|dissimilar air combat tactics]] would be adopted by the [[United States Army Air Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/06/16/ace-served-flying-tigers-china/28837427/ |title = Ace served with Flying Tigers in China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It operated in China jointly along with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), America's first intelligence agency and forerunner of the CIA while also serving as joint training program between the two nations. Among all the wartime missions that Americans set up in China, SACO was the only one that adopted a policy of "total immersion" with the Chinese. The "Rice Paddy Navy" or "What-the-Hell Gang" operated in the China-Burma-India theater, advising and training, forecasting weather and scouting landing areas for USN fleet and Gen Claire Chennault's 14th AF, rescuing downed American flyers, and intercepting Japanese radio traffic. An underlying mission objective during the last year of war was the development and preparation of the China coast for Allied penetration and occupation. The Foochow (Fujian Province) was scouted as a potential staging area and springboard for the future military landing of the [[Allies of World War II]] in Japan.

In February 1941 a Sino-British agreement was forged whereby British troops would assist the Chinese "Surprise Troops" units of guerrillas already operating in China, and China would assist Britain in Burma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirby|first=Major General Woodburn, S|title=The War against Japan, Vol 2: India's Most Dangerous Hour|location=London|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A British-Australian commando operation, [[Mission 204]], was initialized in February 1942 to provide training to Chinese guerilla troops. The mission conducted two operations, mostly in the provinces of Yunnan and Jiangxi. The first phase achieved very little but a second more successful phase was conducted before withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stevens |first=Keith |year=2005 |title=A Token Operation: 204 Military Mission to China, 1941–1945 |journal=Asian Affairs |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=66–74 |publisher=Risk Management Reference Center, EBSCOhost |doi= 10.1080/03068370500039151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commandos working with the [[Free Thai Movement]] also operated in China, mostly while on their way into [[Thailand in World War II|Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2008-featured-story-archive/free-thai-movement.html| title = A Look Back&amp;nbsp;...

After the Japanese blocked the [[Burma Road]] in April 1942, and before the [[Ledo Road]] was finished in early 1945, the majority of US and British supplies to the Chinese had to be delivered via airlift over the eastern end of the [[Himalayan Mountains]] known as [[the Hump]]. Flying over the Himalayas was extremely dangerous, but the airlift continued daily to August 1945, at great cost in men and aircraft.

==Involvement of French Indochina==

The Chinese [[Kuomintang]] also supported the Vietnamese [[Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng]] (VNQDD) in its battle against French and Japanese imperialism.

In [[Guangxi]], Chinese military leaders were organizing Vietnamese nationalists against the Japanese. The VNQDD had been active in Guangxi and some of their members had joined the KMT army.&lt;ref name="William J.

With Ho at the forefront, the [[Viet Minh|Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi]] (Vietnamese Independence League, usually known as the Viet Minh) was formed and based in the town of [[Jingxi, Guangxi|Jingxi]].&lt;ref name="William J.

The front was later broadened and renamed the Viet Nam Giai Phong Dong Minh (Vietnam Liberation League).&lt;ref name="William J. Duiker 1976 272"/&gt;

The Viet Nam Revolutionary League was a union of various Vietnamese nationalist groups, run by the pro Chinese VNQDD. Chinese KMT General [[Zhang Fakui]] created the league to further Chinese influence in Indochina, against the French and Japanese. Its stated goal was for unity with China under the [[Three Principles of the People]], created by KMT founder Dr. Sun and opposition to Japanese and French Imperialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/endlesswarvietna0000harr|url-access=registration|quote=Chang Fa-Kuei vnqdd.|title=The endless war: Vietnam's struggle for independence|author=James P.

==Contemporaneous rebellions==
[[Xinjiang War (1937)|Rebellion occurred]] in the [[Xinjiang]] province in 1937 when a pro-Soviet General [[Sheng Shicai]] invaded the province accompanied by Soviet troops. The invasion was resisted by General [[Ma Hushan]] of the [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)|KMT 36th Division]].

General Ma Hushan was expecting help from Nanjing, as he exchanged messages with Chiang regarding the Soviet attack. But, both the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Xinjiang War erupted simultaneously leaving Chiang and Ma Hushan each on their own to confront the Japanese and Soviet forces.

The Republic of China government was fully aware of the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang province, and Soviet troops moving around Xinjiang and Gansu, but it was forced to mask these maneuvers to the public as "Japanese propaganda" to avoid an international incident and for continued military supplies from the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rsLQdBUgyMUC|title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Journey to the West|author=Hsiao-ting Lin|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=|isbn=978-0-415-58264-3|page=58|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the pro-Soviet governor [[Sheng Shicai]] controlled Xinjiang, which was garrisoned with Soviet troops in [[Turfan]], the Chinese government had to keep troops stationed there as well.

General [[Ma Buqing]] was in virtual control of the [[Gansu]] corridor at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3oeAAAAMAAJ|title=Asia, Volume 40|author=|year=1940|publisher=Asia Magazine|location=|page=|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ma Buqing had earlier fought against the Japanese, but because the Soviet threat was great, Chiang changed Ma's position, in July 1942, by instructing Ma to move 30,000 of his troops to the Tsaidam marsh in the [[Qaidam Basin]] of [[Qinghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=War, Leadership and Ethnopolitics: Chiang Kai-shek and China's frontiers, 1941–1945 |publisher=Informaworld.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/31657/Full_Text.pdf |title=Nationalists, Muslim Warlords, and the "Great Northwestern Development" in Pre-Communist China |author=Hsiao-ting Lin |accessdate=2010-12-02 |publisher=Central Asia-Caucasus Institute &amp; Silk Road Studies Program |date=February 2007 |volume=5 |number=1 |journal=The China and Eurasia Forum Quarterly |pages=115–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiang named Ma as Reclamation Commissioner, to threaten [[Sheng Shicai]]'s southern flank in Xinjiang, which bordered Tsaidam.

After Ma evacuated his positions in Gansu, Kuomintang troops from central China flooded the area, and infiltrated Soviet occupied Xinjiang, gradually reclaiming it and forcing Sheng Shicai to break with the Soviets. The Kuomintang ordered Ma Bufang several times to march his troops into Xinjiang to intimidate the pro-Soviet Governor Sheng Shicai. This helped provide protection for Chinese settling in Xinjiang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvPUAAAAMAAJ|title=A regional handbook on Northwest China, Volume 1|author=Human Relations Area Files, inc|year=1956|publisher=Printed by the Human Relations Area Files|location=|isbn=|page=74|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ili Rebellion]] broke out in Xinjiang when the Kuomintang Hui Officer Liu Bin-Di was killed while fighting Turkic Uyghur rebels in November 1944. The Soviet Union supported the Turkic rebels against the Kuomintang, and Kuomintang forces fought back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4J0uAAAAIAAJ|title=Journal of the Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs, Volumes 4–5|author=Institute of Muslim Minority Affairs|year=1982|publisher=King Abdulaziz University|location=|page=299|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] put an end to the war by attacking the Japanese with a new weapon (on the United States' part) and an incursion into Manchuria (on the Soviet Union's part). On August 6, 1945, an American [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] bomber, the ''[[Enola Gay]]'', dropped the [[Little Boy|first atomic bomb used in combat]] on [[Hiroshima]], killing tens of thousands and leveling the city. On August 9, 1945, the Soviet Union renounced [[Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact|its non-aggression pact]] with Japan and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|attacked the Japanese in Manchuria]], fulfilling its [[Yalta Conference]] pledge to attack the Japanese within three months after the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of the war in Europe]]. The attack was made by three Soviet army groups. On that same day, a second more destructive atomic bomb was dropped by the United States on [[Nagasaki]].

After the Allied victory in the Pacific, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] ordered all Japanese forces within China (excluding [[Manchuria]]), [[Taiwan]] and [[French Indochina]] north of 16° north latitude to surrender to [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and the Japanese troops in China formally surrendered on September 9, 1945, at 9:00.&lt;ref name="surrender"&gt;[http://www.taiwandocuments.org/surrender02.htm Act of Surrender, 9 September 1945] (page visited on 3 September 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; The ninth hour of the ninth day of the ninth month was chosen in echo of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] (on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month) and because "nine" is [[Numbers in Chinese culture#Nine|homophone of the word for "long lasting"]] in Chinese (to suggest that the peace won would last forever).&lt;ref&gt;Hans Van De Ven, "A call to not lead humanity into another war", ''[[China Daily]]'', 31 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war struggle and resumption of civil war===
{{Main|Chinese Civil War}}
[[File:Liuchow 1945.jpg|thumb|The Chinese return to Liuzhou in July 1945.]]
[[File:重慶會談 蔣介石與毛澤東.jpg|thumb|Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong in 1945]]

In 1945, China emerged from the war nominally a great military power {{citation needed|date=October 2019}} but economically weak and on the verge of all-out civil war. The economy was sapped by the military demands of a long costly war and internal strife, by spiraling inflation, and by corruption in the Nationalist government that included profiteering, speculation and hoarding.

Furthermore, as part of the Yalta Conference, which allowed a Soviet sphere of influence in Manchuria, the Soviets dismantled and removed more than half of the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese before handing over Manchuria to China. Large swathes of the prime farming areas had been ravaged by the fighting and there was starvation in the wake of the war. Many towns and cities were destroyed, and millions were rendered homeless by floods.

The problems of rehabilitation and reconstruction after the ravages of a protracted war were staggering, and the war left the Nationalists severely weakened, and their policies left them unpopular. Meanwhile, the war strengthened the Communists both in popularity and as a viable fighting force. At Yan'an and elsewhere in the communist controlled areas, Mao Zedong was able to adapt [[Marxism–Leninism]] to Chinese conditions. He taught party cadres to lead the masses by living and working with them, eating their food, and thinking their thoughts.

The [[Chinese Red Army]] fostered an image of conducting guerrilla warfare in defense of the people. Communist troops adapted to changing wartime conditions and became a seasoned fighting force. With skillful organization and propaganda, the Communists increased party membership from 100,000 in 1937 to 1.2 million by 1945.

Mao also began to execute his plan to establish a new China by rapidly moving his forces from Yan'an and elsewhere to Manchuria. This opportunity was available to the Communists because although Nationalist representatives were not invited to Yalta, they had been consulted and had agreed to the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in the belief that the Soviet Union would cooperate only with the Nationalist government after the war.

However, the Soviet occupation of Manchuria was long enough to allow the Communist forces to move in en masse and arm themselves with the military hardware surrendered by the Imperial Japanese Army, quickly establish control in the countryside and move into position to encircle the Nationalist government army in major cities of northeast China. Following that, the Chinese Civil War broke out between the Nationalists and Communists, which concluded with the Communist victory in [[mainland China]] and the retreat of the Nationalists to [[Taiwan]] in 1949.

===Aftermath===
[[File:AntijapaneseWarMemorialMuseum.jpg|thumb|China War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial Museum on the site where the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] took place]]

The question as to which political group directed the Chinese war effort and exerted most of the effort to resist the Japanese remains a controversial issue.

In the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan Memorial near the [[Lugou Bridge|Marco Polo Bridge]] and in mainland Chinese textbooks, the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) claims that the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] mostly avoided fighting the Japanese to preserve their strength for a final showdown with the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC or CCP), while the Communists were the main military force in the Chinese resistance efforts.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Recently, however, with a change in the political climate, the CPC has admitted that certain Nationalist generals made important contributions in resisting the Japanese. The official history in mainland China now states that the KMT fought a bloody, yet indecisive, frontal war against Japan, while the CPC engaged the Japanese forces in far greater numbers behind enemy lines. For the sake of [[Chinese reunification]] and appeasing the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on [[Taiwan]], the PRC has begun to acknowledge the Nationalists and the Communists as equal contributors, because the victory over Japan belonged to the [[Chinese people]], rather than to any political party.&lt;ref name="China Observes Date of Japan's Surrender—New York Times"&gt;{{Cite news

The Nationalists suffered higher casualties because they were the main combatants opposing the Japanese in each of the 22 major battles (involving more than 100,000 troops on both sides) between China and Japan. The Communist forces, by contrast, usually avoided pitched battles with the Japanese and generally limited their combat to guerilla actions (the [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Pingxingguan]] are notable exceptions). The Nationalists committed their strongest divisions in early battle against the Japanese (including the 36th, 87th, 88th divisions, the crack divisions of Chiang's Central Army) to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]] and continued to deploy most of their forces to fight the Japanese even as the Communists changed their strategy to engage mainly in a political offensive against the Japanese while declaring that the CPC should "save and preserve our strength and wait for favorable timing" by the end of 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Yang Kuisong, "The Formation and Implementation of the Chinese Communists' Guerrilla Warfare Strategy in the Enemy's Rear during the Sino-Japanese War", paper presented at Harvard University Conference on Wartime China, Maui, January 2004, pp. 32–36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===China-Japan relations===
Today, the war is a major point of contention and resentment between China and Japan. The war remains a major roadblock for [[People's Republic of China–Japan relations|Sino-Japanese relations]].

Issues regarding the current historical outlook on the war exist. For example, the Japanese government has been accused of [[historical revisionism]] by allowing the approval of a few [[Japanese textbook controversy|school textbooks]] omitting or glossing over Japan's militant past, although the most recent controversial book, the ''New History Textbook'' was used by only 0.039% of junior high schools in Japan&lt;ref&gt;Sven Saaler: Politics, Memory and Public Opinion: The History Textbook Controversy and Japanese Society. Munich: 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and despite the efforts of the Japanese nationalist textbook reformers, by the late 1990s the most common Japanese schoolbooks contained references to, for instance, the [[Nanjing Massacre]], [[Unit 731]], and the [[comfort women]] of World War II, all historical issues which have faced challenges from ultranationalists in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/stories/s841387.htm|title=Foreign Correspondent – 22/04/2003: Japan – Unit 731|work=abc.net.au|accessdate=August 13, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803172812/http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/stories/s841387.htm|archive-date=August 3, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on Taiwan===

[[Taiwan]] and the [[Penghu]] islands were put under the administrative control of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) government in 1945 by the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]].&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,TWN,,4954ce6323,0.html World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples&amp;nbsp;– Taiwan : Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728144641/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CTWN%2C%2C4954ce6323%2C0.html |date=July 28, 2011 }} UNHCR&lt;/ref&gt; The ROC proclaimed Taiwan [[Retrocession Day]] on October 25, 1945. However, due to the unresolved Chinese Civil War, neither the newly established [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in [[mainland China]] nor the Nationalist ROC that retreated to Taiwan was invited to sign the [[Treaty of San Francisco]], as neither had shown full and complete legal capacity to enter into an international legally binding agreement.&lt;ref name="aao.sinica.edu.tw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aao.sinica.edu.tw/download/publication_e/Year2007/human12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326201339/http://aao.sinica.edu.tw/download/publication_e/Year2007/human12.pdf |archivedate=March 26, 2009 |df=mdy-all }} Disputes over Taiwanese Sovereignty and the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty Since World War II&lt;/ref&gt; Since China was not present, the Japanese only formally renounced the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan and Penghu islands without specifying to which country Japan relinquished the sovereignty, and the treaty was signed in 1951 and came into force in 1952.

In 1952, the [[Treaty of Taipei]] was signed separately between the ROC and Japan that basically followed the same guideline of the Treaty of San Francisco, not specifying which country has sovereignty over Taiwan. However, Article 10 of the treaty states that the [[Taiwanese people]] and the juridical person should be the people and the juridical person of the ROC.&lt;ref name="unhcr.org"/&gt; Both the PRC and ROC governments base their claims to Taiwan on the [[Japanese Instrument of Surrender]] which specifically accepted the [[Potsdam Declaration]] which refers to the [[1943 Cairo Declaration|Cairo Declaration]]. Disputes over the precise de jure sovereign of Taiwan persist to the present. On a de facto basis, sovereignty over Taiwan has been and continues to be exercised by the ROC. Japan's position has been to avoid commenting on Taiwan's status, maintaining that Japan renounced all claims to sovereignty over its former colonial possessions after World War II, including Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.kyodo.co.jp/modules/fstStory/index.php?storyid=453676]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} FOCUS: Taiwan–Japan ties back on shaky ground as Taipei snubs Tokyo envoy&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the [[Republic of China]] government has held celebrations marking the [[Victory Day]] on September 9 (now known as [[Armed Forces Day]]) and Taiwan's [[Retrocession Day]] on October 25. However, after the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[2000 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election]] in 2000, these national holidays commemorating the war have been cancelled as the [[Taiwan Independence|pro-independent]] DPP does not see the relevancy of celebrating events that happened in mainland China.

Meanwhile, many KMT supporters, particularly veterans who retreated with the government in 1949, still have an emotional interest in the war. For example, in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of war in 2005, the cultural bureau of KMT stronghold [[Taipei]] held a series of talks in the [[Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall]] regarding the war and post-war developments, while the KMT held its own exhibit in the KMT headquarters. Whereas the KMT won the [[2008 Republic of China presidential election|presidential election]] in 2008, the ROC government resumed commemorating the war.

The Japanese recorded around 1.1 to 1.9 million military casualties during all of World War II (which include killed, wounded and missing). The official death toll of Japanese men killed in China, according to the Japan Defense Ministry, is 480,000. Based on the investigation of the Japanese ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', the military death toll of Japan in China is about 700,000 since 1937 (excluding the deaths in Manchuria).&lt;ref name="Yomiuri Shimbun"/&gt;

Another source from Hilary Conroy claims that a total of 447,000 Japanese soldiers died in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Of the 1,130,000 Imperial Japanese Army soldiers who died during World War II, 39 percent died in China.&lt;ref name="Coox pp. 308"/&gt;

Then in ''[[War Without Mercy]]'', [[John W. Dower]] claims that a total of 396,000 Japanese soldiers died in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Of this number, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] lost 388,605 soldiers and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] lost 8,000 soldiers. Another 54,000 soldiers also died after the war had ended, mostly from illness and starvation.&lt;ref name="Coox pp. 308"&gt;ed. [[Alvin Coox|Coox, Alvin]] and Hilary Conroy "China and Japan: A Search for Balance since World War I", pp. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 1,740,955 Japanese soldiers who died during World War II, 22 percent died in China.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;Dower, John "War Without Mercy", pp. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese statistics, however, lack complete estimates for the wounded. From 1937 to 1941, 185,647 Japanese soldiers were killed in China and 520,000 were wounded. Disease also incurred critical losses on Japanese forces. From 1937 to 1941, 430,000 Japanese soldiers were recorded as being sick. In North China alone, 18,000 soldiers were evacuated back to Japan for illnesses in 1938, 23,000 in 1939, and 15,000 in 1940.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt;{{efn|This number does not include the casualties of the large numbers of Chinese collaborator government troops fighting on the Japanese side.|group=efn}} From 1941 to 1945: 202,958 dead; another 54,000 dead after war's end. Chinese forces also report that by May 1945, 22,293 Japanese soldiers were captured as prisoners. Many more Japanese soldiers surrendered when the war ended.&lt;ref name="Coox pp. 308"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt;

Contemporary studies from the Beijing Central Compilation and Translation Press have revealed that the Japanese suffered a total of 2,227,200 casualties, including 1,055,000 dead and 1,172,341 injured. This Chinese publication analyzes statistics provided by Japanese publications and claimed these numbers were largely based on Japanese publications.&lt;ref name="Press"/&gt;

Both Nationalist and Communist Chinese sources report that their respective forces were responsible for the deaths of over 1.7 million Japanese soldiers.{{Sfn|Hsu|page=565}} Nationalist War Minister [[He Yingqin]] himself contested the Communists' claims, finding it impossible for a force of "untrained, undisciplined, poorly equipped" guerrillas of Communist forces to have killed so many enemy soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;ed. Coox, Alvin and Hilary Conroy "China and Japan: A Search for Balance since World War I", pp. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Chinese authorities ridiculed Japanese estimates of Chinese casualties. In 1940, the National Herald stated that the Japanese exaggerated Chinese casualties, while deliberately concealing the true number of Japanese casualties, releasing false figures that made them appear lower. The article reports on the casualty situation of the war up to 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6Rknr9XSMggC&amp;dq=was+ridiculed+by+Nationalist+authorities+as+japanese&amp;q=The+Japanese+attempt+to+exagerate+the+number+of+casualties+on+the+part+of+China+and+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+herald|title=China monthly review, Volume 95|author=|year=1940|publisher=Millard Publishing Co.|page=187|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=The+Japanese+attempt+to+exagerate+the+number+of+casualties+on+the+part+of+China+and+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+herald&amp;btnG=Search+Books#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbs=bks%3A1&amp;q=The+Japanese+attempt++on+the+part+of+china+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+Herald&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=c295382bce16bc53 |title=Google search of the source |date=2004-05-23 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=The+Japanese+attempt+to+exagerate+the+number+of+casualties+on+the+part+of+China+and+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+herald&amp;btnG=Search+Books#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbs=bks%3A1&amp;q=The+Japanese+attempt++on+the+part+of+china+to+minimize+the+number+of+casualties+in+Japan+was%2C+stated+the+National+Herald+cheat+the+japanese+people&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=c295382bce16bc53 |title=(Google search of the source) |date=2004-05-23 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and a resolution adopted by the [[League of Nations]] on May 14, 1938, condemning the use of poison gas by the [[Empire of Japan]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] frequently used chemical weapons during the war.

According to historians [[Yoshiaki Yoshimi]] and Seiya Matsuno, the chemical weapons were authorized by specific orders given by [[Emperor of Japan|Japanese Emperor]] [[Hirohito]] himself, transmitted by the [[Imperial General Headquarters]]. For example, the Emperor authorized the use of toxic gas on 375 separate occasions during the [[Battle of Wuhan]] from August to October 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Yoshimi and S. Matsuno, ''Dokugasusen Kankei Shiryō II (Materials on poison gas warfare), Kaisetsu, Hōkan 2, Jugonen Sensō Gokuhi Shiryōshu'', 1997, pp. 27–29&lt;/ref&gt; They were also used during the [[Battle of Changde|invasion of Changde]]. Those orders were transmitted either by [[Prince Kan'in Kotohito]] or General [[Hajime Sugiyama]].&lt;ref&gt;Yoshimi and Matsuno, ''idem'', [[Herbert P. Bix|Herbert Bix]], Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, 2001, pp. 360–364&lt;/ref&gt; Gases manufactured in [[Okunoshima]] were used more than 2,000 times against Chinese soldiers and civilians in the war in China in the 1930s and 1940s&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas D.

[[Biological warfare|Bacteriological weapons]] provided by [[Shirō Ishii]]'s [[Unit 731|units]] were also profusely used. For example, in 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force bombed [[Ningbo]] with [[flea]]s carrying the [[bubonic plague]].&lt;ref&gt;''Japan triggered bubonic plague outbreak, doctor claims'', [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-triggered-bubonic-plague-outbreak-doctor-claims-704147.html], Prince [[Tsuneyoshi Takeda]] and [[Prince Mikasa]] received a special screening by [[Shirō Ishii]] of a film showing imperial planes loading germ bombs for bubonic dissemination over Ningbo in 1940. (Daniel Barenblatt, ''A Plague upon Humanity'', 2004, p. 32.) All these weapons were experimented with on humans before being used in the field. {{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-triggered-bubonic-plague-outbreak-doctor-claims-704147.html|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912142325/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-triggered-bubonic-plague-outbreak-doctor-claims-704147.html|archivedate=September 12, 2011|url-status=bot: unknown|accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]] the accused, such as Major General Kiyashi Kawashima, testified that, in 1941, some 40 members of Unit 731 air-dropped [[Plague (disease)|plague]]-contaminated fleas on [[Changde]].
