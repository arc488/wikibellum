The '''Battle of Sidon''' (13–15 June 1941) was part of the [[7th Division (Australia)|Australian 7th Division]]'s advance on [[Beirut]], which took place during the five-week-long [[Syria-Lebanon campaign]] fought between the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and [[Vichy French]] forces in [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]].

[[Sidon]], a town of about 12,000 people at the time with a number of historic mosques and castles dating back to the [[Crusades]],{{sfn|Long|1953|p=379}} was positioned on the coast to the north of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], about halfway between the Lebanese border with [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Beirut]].{{sfn|Dennis et al|1995|p=578}} The fighting came several days after the Allied forces from the Australian [[21st Brigade (Australia)|21st Brigade]], under Brigadier [[Jack Stevens]],  crossed the [[Battle of the Litani River|Litani River]] as part of Operation Exporter. After preliminary moves by the [[2/27th Battalion (Australia)|2/27th Infantry Battalion]] around Adloun, the [[2/14th Battalion (Australia)|2/14th Infantry Battalion]] had carried the advance north along the coast towards Sidon. On 13 June, the [[2/16th Battalion (Australia)|2/16th Infantry Battalion]], with artillery and cavalry support, was assigned the task of capturing the town itself,{{sfn|Long|1953|p=380}} undertaking a daylight advance over {{convert|6.5|km|mi}} of open ground to reach the town, before exploiting a further {{convert|4.5|km|mi}} to the north.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt; The presence of the historic buildings meant that the Australian artillery bombardment of the town was limited in an effort to prevent collateral damage, which slowed the Allied advance.&lt;ref name=harriott/&gt;

On the periphery, the 2/27th was also active around Miyeoumiye to the south-east during the fighting. The town fell on 15 June, after the Australians completed a long approach march and overcame a determined French counterattack the included tanks.{{sfn|Long|1953|pp=380–384}}&lt;ref name=AWM&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/E84349 |title=Capture of Sidon |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=26 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; French aircraft were also active during the battle, attacking the [[2/4th Field Regiment (Australia)|2/4th Field Regiment]]'s positions and the headquarters of the 2/16th Infantry Battalion.&lt;ref name=AWM/&gt;

The day after Sidon fell, further actions were fought to the east between Algerian [[Tirailleur]]s and the Australians around the high ground at Meidelyoum and Jabal Aababy, as the Australians cut the road between Sidon and [[Battle of Jezzine (1941)|Jezzine]],&lt;ref name=harriott&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/41934739 |author=Harriott, G.

The next stage of the fighting saw the Australians advance towards [[Battle of Damour|Damour]], which fell in early July.{{sfn|Dennis et al|1995|p=578}}  Following the war, a [[battle honour]] was awarded to the 2/16th and 2/27th Infantry Battalions, the [[2/3rd Machine Gun Battalion (Australia)|2/3rd Machine Gun Battalion]], and the [[2/6th Cavalry Commando Regiment (Australia)|6th]] and [[2/9th Cavalry Commando Regiment (Australia)|9th Divisional Cavalry Regiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.gov.au/ahu/docs/BattleHonours_WWII_Syria.pdf |title=Battle Honours of the Australian Army: World War II&amp;nbsp;– Syria |accessdate=30 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603162103/http://www.army.gov.au///AHU/docs/BattleHonours_WWII_Syria.pdf |publisher=Army History Unit |archivedate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
