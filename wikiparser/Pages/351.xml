The '''Dnieper–Carpathian Offensive''', also known in Soviet historical sources as the '''liberation of [[right-bank Ukraine]]''', was a [[strategic offensive]] executed by the Soviet [[1st Ukrainian Front|1st]], [[2nd Ukrainian Front|2nd]], [[3rd Ukrainian Front|3rd]], and [[4th Ukrainian Front]]s, along with the [[2nd Belorussian Front]], against the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Army Group South]] and [[Army Group A]], and fought from 24 December 1943 – 17 April 1944. The battles on the right-bank Ukraine and in the [[Crimean offensive|Crimea]] were the most important event of the 1944 winter-spring campaign on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The goal of this offensive was to split Wehrmacht's Army Group South and to clear the German-Romanian-Hungarian forces from most of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] and [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldovian]] territories, which were occupied by [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis forces]]. It was one of the biggest offensives of [[World War II]], stretching over a 1,000 km (620 mi) front and involving almost 3,500,000 troops from both sides.  

In the course of the operation, 20 Wehrmacht divisions were either destroyed, disbanded or required major rebuilding, while another 60 divisions were reduced to 50% of their establishment strength.&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, pp. 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;62nd, 82nd, 123rd, 125th, 167th, 387th Infantry Divisions, Korpsabteilung B, 143rd, 147th Reserve Infantry Divisions, 5th Luftwaffe Field Division, were disbanded. 

1st SS Panzer Division "Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler", 6th, 9th , 11th, 19th , 25th Panzer Divisions, 16th Panzergrenadier Division, 2nd Parachute Division, 34th, 198th Infantry Divisions were withdrawn from the front and sent to the West for a refit. 

As cited in Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, pp. 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt; Even worse were equipment losses, with thousands of precious tanks, assault guns, artillery and trucks being lost, principally through their abandonment in the spring mud.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Liedtke (2015). Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; According to German General [[Kurt von Tippelskirch]], this was the biggest Wehrmacht defeat since Stalingrad.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this strategic offensive, [[Wehrmacht|Wehrmacht's]] [[Army Group South]] was split into two parts- north and south of the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The northern portion was pushed back into [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] ([[Poland]]), while the southern portion was pushed back into [[Romania]]. The northern portion was renamed to [[Army Group North Ukraine]], while the southern portion to [[Army Group South Ukraine]], which was effective from 5 April 1944, although very little of Ukraine remained in German hands. It was during this offensive that the Red Army for the first time reached the pre-war June 1941 state border of USSR, after which they transferred the combat into Polish and Romanian territory.&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to save its southern sector from complete collapse, the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|German high command]] was forced to transfer 8 divisions in January- February&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; and another 26 German divisions as reinforcements&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Liedtke (2015). Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; between March- May from across [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Poland]], [[Balkans]] and [[Army Group Centre]] to the crumbling front of [[Army Group South]]. This amounted to a total of 34 divisions,&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; 550,000 men and 853 tanks, assault guns, and self-propelled anti-tank guns.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gregory Liedtke (2015). Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a result, the Soviet Dnieper-Carpathian Offensive played a key role in influencing the future successes of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Normandy landings|D-Day]] landings and Soviet [[Operation Bagration]], as German forces stationed in France and belonging to Army Group Centre were critically weakened by those transfers.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Liedtke (2015). Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; All told, during the [[Kamenets-Podolsky pocket|major crisis in the Western Ukraine]], the [[OB West|German forces stationed in France]] were deprived of 45,827 troops&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Liedtke (2015). Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, pp. 227-228.&lt;/ref&gt; and 363 tanks, assault guns, and self-propelled anti-tank guns [[Normandy landings|on 6 June 1944]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Liedtke (2015). Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, [[Army Group Centre|Army Group Center]] was deprived of a total of 125,380 troops&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Liedtke (2015). Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; and 552 tanks, assault guns, and self-propelled anti-tank guns on [[Operation Bagration|22 June 1944]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Liedtke (2015). Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Wehrmacht defeat, the commander of Army Group South [[Erich von Manstein]] and the commander of [[Army Group A]] [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]] were dismissed by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and replaced by [[Walter Model|Walther Model]] and [[Ferdinand Schörner]] respectively.

This was the only offensive in which for the first time in the war, all 6 elite Soviet tank armies had participated at the same time. Similarly, most of the Wehrmacht's panzer divisions stationed in the East were deployed in the Ukraine, belonging to Army Group South. Out of 30 panzer and panzer-grenadier divisions available in late 1943, 22 were stationed in the Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
During the massive [[Battle of the Dnieper]] in autumn 1943, which secured the [[Left-bank Ukraine|Left-bank]] or eastern Ukraine and cut off the German [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th Army]] in the [[Crimea]], several Soviet bridgeheads were established across the right bank of the [[Dnieper River]], which was declared to be "[[Panther–Wotan line|East Wall]]" by the Germans. These bridgeheads were expanded throughout November and December and became the platforms from which the Dnieper–Carpathian Offensive was launched.&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of these bridgeheads centered around [[Kiev]] was up to 240 km wide and 120 km deep, and was occupied by the troops of the [[1st Ukrainian Front]].&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The other, in the region of [[Cherkasy]], [[Znamianka|Znamenka]], and [[Dnipro|Dnepropetrovsk]], was up to 350 km wide and 30 to 100 km deep, and was occupied by troops of the [[Steppe Front|2nd]] and [[3rd Ukrainian Front|3rd]] Ukrainian fronts.

Meanwhile, the troops of the [[4th Ukrainian Front]] reached the lower reaches of the Dnieper in the [[Kakhovka]]-[[Oleshky|Tsyurupinsk]] sector, and had cut off the German 17th Army stationed in the Crimean peninsula, while also seizing a bridgehead on the southern coast of [[Syvash|Sivash]].

The troops of the [[North Caucasian Front|North Caucasus Front]] ([[18th Army (Soviet Union)|18th]] and [[56th Army (Soviet Union)|56th]] Armies, [[4th Air and Air Defence Forces Army|4th Air Army]]) in early November 1943, with the assistance of the [[Black Sea Fleet]] and the [[Azov Flotilla]], crossed the [[Kerch Strait]] and captured the bridgehead on the [[Kerch Peninsula]].

==Forces involved and their plans==

====Axis====
After a heavy defeat in the summer-autumn campaign of 1943, the German forces adopted a posture of strategic defense. The main line of the strategic behavior of the German forces on the Soviet-German front was stubborn defense in order to keep the occupied lines.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for stubborn defense on the Soviet-German front were determined by political and, most importantly, economic factors.

By holding the lines in the Ukraine, the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|German High Command]], [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] foremost, hoped to prevent the German allies, namely [[Romania]], [[Hungary]] and Bulgaria, from leaving the [[Axis powers|Axis]] military-political bloc. German General [[Kurt von Tippelskirch]] wrote the following:&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

"''The front was rapidly approaching the Balkans. We had to fear that if events continued to develop with the same speed, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary, despite their fear of Bolshevism, would become unreliable allies. The example of Italy was in this sense highly indicative''".

The most important reason for holding the right-bank Ukraine was economic. The control of the Ukraine allowed the German leadership to export food and important strategic raw materials to Germany. In their calculations for stubborn defense, the Germans attached particular importance to the retention of the [[right-bank Ukraine]] and [[Crimea]] with their rich food resources, manganese production centers around [[Nikopol, Ukraine|Nikopol]], iron ore production centers around [[Kryvyi Rih|Krivoy Rog]] and [[Kerch]], as well as the [[Black Sea]] basin with first-class seaports.

The German command took into account the important strategic position of the right bank of the Ukraine and Crimea, as areas covering the approaches to southern [[Poland]] and the [[Balkans]] and ensuring control over the central and western parts of the Black Sea.

[[Erich von Manstein|Erich von Manstein's]] [[Army Group South]] and [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist's]] [[Army Group A]] consisted of 2 panzer and 2 field armies (from north to south):

*[[4th Panzer Army]] in the [[Zhitomir]] region, west of [[Kiev]], commanded by [[Erhard Raus]];
*[[1st Panzer Army]] of [[Hans-Valentin Hube]], in the [[Vinnytsia|Vinnitsa]] region and as far as [[Cherkassy]] to the south;
*[[8th Army (Wehrmacht)|8th Army]] commanded by [[Otto Wöhler]] in the region of [[Kirovograd]];
*[[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]] (recreated after [[Battle of Stalingrad|its destruction at Stalingrad]]) under [[Karl-Adolf Hollidt]] in the [[Kryvyi Rih|Krivoy-Rog]]-[[Nikopol, Ukraine|Nikopol]] salient.

The German forces were also supported by the following [[Axis powers|Axis]] armies: 

*[[Third Army (Romania)|3rd Romanian Army]], also rebuilt after Stalingrad, under command of [[Petre Dumitrescu]] in the [[Taurida Governorate|Tavridia]] area, just north of [[Crimea]];
*[[Fourth Army (Romania)|4th Romanian Army]] hastily assembled under command of [[Ioan Mihail Racoviţă]] in the area of Soviet Moldavian Republic;
*[[First Army (Hungary)|1st Hungarian Army]], held in reserve in the north-western Ukraine.

All told, on the [[right-bank Ukraine]] the combined German-Romanian-Hungarian forces had a total of 93 divisions (including 18 panzer and 4 panzer-grenadier), 2 motorized brigades, 3 heavy panzer battalions of [[Tiger I|Tiger]] tanks, 18 [[Sturmgeschütz|StuG]] Assault Gun Brigades, a battalion of "Ferdinand" or [[Elefant]] tank destroyer, several anti-tank battalions,  as well as a large number of artillery, construction, engineering and other units.&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, this amounted to 40% of all German troops and 72% of all panzer divisions stationed on the Eastern Front. Army Group South was supported by the [[Luftwaffe]]'s [[Luftflotte 4]] ([[1st Air Corps (Germany)|1st]], [[4th Air Corps (Germany)|4th]] and [[8th Air Corps (Germany)|8th]] Air Corps), as well as the bulk of the [[Romanian Air Force|Romanian air force]]. The headquarters of the [[Luftflotte 4]] was in [[Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine|Proskurov]], the 8th Air Corps in [[Vinnytsia|Vinnitsa]], the 4th Air Corps in [[Balta, Odessa Oblast|Balta]], the 1st Air Corps in [[Pervomaisk, Mykolaiv Oblast|Pervomaisk]], and the headquarters of the Romanian Air Corps in [[Odessa]].

All along the vast front, the Germans hastily built defenses. The main defense zone with a depth of 4–6 km had a developed system of trenches, communications and various kinds of engineering barriers.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; On the most important directions, 6–15 km from the front line, a second line of defense was built. In the operational depth along the banks of the [[Horyn River|Goryn]], [[Southern Bug]], [[Inhulets River|Ingulets]], [[Dniester]] and [[Prut]] rivers, new fortifications were erected while the available fortifications were modernized.

The German forces operating on the right-bank Ukraine intended not only to keep the occupied lines, but also to try and liquidate the Soviet bridgeheads on the right bank of the Dnieper, as well as to strike from the Nikopol bridgehead to the south and from the Crimea to the north, in order to re-establish a land connection with the German forces stationed in Crimea. 

By the end of 1943, the German forces operating in Ukraine were driven back to the line of [[Ovruch]], [[Radomyshl]], [[Kaniv|Kanev]], Bashtina, [[Marhanets|Marganets]], Kachachrovka. On the left bank of the Dnieper, south of [[Nikopol, Ukraine|Nikopol]], the Germans kept a bridgehead with a depth of 30 km and a width of 120 km, which was called the "Nikopol Bridgehead".&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

Both [[Erich von Manstein]] and [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]] demanded that their forces be allowed to pull back to more defensible positions, however, they were overruled by Hitler who ordered his armies to stand where they were.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Liedtke (2015). Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, pp. 218-219.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Hitler's orders, German troops retreated anyway, often in direct disregard of orders or after submitting ﬁctitious reports to justify their actions.

====Soviet====
The Stavka committed four Fronts to the operation, with the Belorussian Front providing a strategic flank security to the north in the [[Gomel]]-[[Mogilev]] area, but taking little part in the actual operation. It included the [[13th Army (Soviet Union)|13th]] and [[65th Army (Soviet Union)|65th]] Armies. 
From north to the south, opposing 4th Panzer, 1st Panzer, 8th and 6th Armies respectively: 

[[Nikolai Vatutin|Nikolai Vatutin's]] [[1st Ukrainian Front]] had the [[60th Army (Soviet Union)|60th]], [[1st Guards Army (Soviet Union)|1st Guards]], [[6th Guards Tank Army|6th Guards Tank]]&lt;ref name="Pimlot332"&gt;Pimlott, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; and [[40th Army (Soviet Union)|40th Armies]], while also possessing significant armored reserves in the [[3rd Guards Army (Soviet Union)|3rd Guards Army]] and the [[1st Guards Tank Army (Soviet Union)|1st]] and [[20th Guards Army (Russia)|4th Tank Armies]], backed up by the [[18th Army (Soviet Union)|18th]] and [[38th Army (Soviet Union)|38th Armies]] and the [[2nd Air Army]]. 

[[Ivan Konev|Ivan Konev's]] [[Steppe Front|2nd Ukrainian Front]] to the south led with the [[27th Army (Soviet Union)|27th]], [[7th Guards Army|7th Guards]] and [[53rd Army (Soviet Union)|53rd Armies]], with reserves including the [[5th Guards Tank Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Tank]] and [[2nd Guards Tank Army (Soviet Union)|2nd Guards Tank]] armies, and the [[4th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|4th Guards Army]], all supported by the [[5th Air Army]]. 

[[Rodion Malinovsky|Rodion Malinovsky's]] [[3rd Ukrainian Front]] had the [[57th Army (Soviet Union)|57th]], [[46th Army (Soviet Union)|46th]], [[8th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|8th Guards]] and [[37th Army (Soviet Union)|37th]] armies leading his front, with the [[6th Army (Soviet Union)|6th Army]] in reserve, and the [[17th Air Army]] providing [[air support]]. 

[[Fyodor Tolbukhin|Fyodor Tolbukhin's]] [[4th Ukrainian Front]] would have the most difficult job in conducting [[combined operations]] of his [[Separate Coastal Army]] and the [[Black Sea Fleet]] while the [[5th Army (Soviet Union)|5th]] and [[2nd Guards Army (Soviet Union)|2nd Guards]] armies would cut off escape routes over land for the German 17th Army with air support from the [[8th Air Army]] and the Black Sea Fleet naval aviation.

In accordance with the general military-political task of completely clearing the Soviet land from the German forces and restoring the USSR’s state borders from the [[Barents Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]], the Soviet Supreme Command, [[Stavka|STAVKA]], for the winter of 1943/44 planned a series of major offensive operations- near [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] and [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]], in [[Belarus]], on the [[right-bank Ukraine]] and in the [[Crimea]].&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

in the upcoming winter offensive, the main efforts of the [[Red Army]] forces were concentrated in the south with the task of liberating right-Bank Ukraine and Crimea. This would ensure the defeat of the largest strategic grouping of the Germans ([[Army Group South]]), the return to the Soviet control of economically important areas of [[Kryvyi Rih|Krivoy Rog]], [[Kerch]], [[Nikopol, Ukraine|Nikopol]], the fertile lands of Ukraine and Crimea, first-class ports of the Black Sea, as well as the creation of necessary conditions for a further attack on the Balkans, Poland and towards the flank of Army Group Center, operating in Belarus.

To fulfill the goals, the Soviet command utilized the troops of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Ukrainian fronts, [[Separate Coastal Army]], the [[Black Sea Fleet]], the [[Azov Flotilla]], as well as the partisans operating in the rear of the Germans.
According to the plan, which was formed by December 1943, the 1st Ukrainian Front was to crush the north wing of Army Group South by a blow from [[Kiev]] to [[Mohyliv-Podilskyi|Mogilev-Podolsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н.

Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Ukrainian fronts with blows from the north, east and south were supposed to surround and destroy the Krivoi Rog-Nikopol group of the Germans. At the end of December 1943, the situation prevailing in Ukraine made it necessary to change this plan somewhat. Instead of a deep blow to the south, in the direction of [[Kazanka, Ukraine|Kazanka]], [[Bereznehuvate|Bereznegovatoye]], the 2nd Ukrainian Front had to attack with the main forces towards [[Kropyvnytskyi|Kirovograd]], [[Pervomaisk, Mykolaiv Oblast|Pervomaisk]].

In early January 1944, the plan for the actions of the Red Army troops was reduced in general terms to the following. The 1st Ukrainian Front would launch the main attack on [[Vinnytsia|Vinnitsa]], Mogilev-Podolsky, with part of the forces being directed towards [[Lutsk]] and Khristinovka. The 2nd Ukrainian Front would launch the main attack on Kirovograd, Pervomaisk, with part of the forces being also directed towards Khristinovka, These combined Soviet offensives were to shatter the main forces of Army Group South, after which the Red Army would advance towards the [[Carpathian Mountains]], thereby leading to a split of Army Group South. The actions of these fronts were coordinated by the [[Stavka|STAVKA]] representative Marshal of the Soviet Union [[Georgy Zhukov|G.K. Zhukov]].

The troops of the 3rd and 4th Ukrainian fronts would struck two converging blows in the directions of Nikopol, [[Novovorontsovka|Novo-Vorontsovka]] and were to defeat the Nikopol-Krivoi Rog grouping of the Germans, then to develop an attack towards [[Mykolaiv|Nikolaev]], [[Odessa]] and free the entire Black Sea coast. At the same time, the 4th Ukrainian Front was only initially engaged for joint actions with the 3rd Ukrainian Front to defeat the Germans in the Nikopol area- subsequently, the front switched to defeating the enemy in Crimea, together with the [[Separate Coastal Army]], the [[Black Sea Fleet]] and the [[Azov Flotilla|Azov military flotilla]]. The actions of the 3rd and 4th Ukrainian Fronts were coordinated by the STAVKA representative Marshal of the Soviet Union [[Aleksandr Vasilevsky|A. M. Vasilevsky]].

Such a sequence was envisaged in solving the tasks: first, defeat the Germans in the areas adjacent to the Dnieper, and throw them back to the line of the Southern Bug river, Pervomaisk, Ingulets river. In the future, to develop an offensive to the west and southwest, reach the line of Lutsk, [[Mohyliv-Podilskyi|Mogilev-Podolsky]] and the Dniester river.

The beginning of the operation to liberate Crimea was made dependent on the liquidation of the Nikopol-Krivoy Rog grouping of the Germans. Then, however, the deteriorating weather conditions in Crimea forced the beginning of this operation to be postponed until April.&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet partisans]] were given the task of strengthening the attacks on German communications, road junctions, crossings, their rear garrisons, thereby assisting the Red Army.

All told, at the start of January 1944 the 4 Soviet Ukrainian Fronts (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Ukrainian Fronts) had a total of 21 combined-arms armies, 3 tank armies and 4 air armies- a total of 169 rifle divisions, 9 cavalry divisions, 18 tank and mechanized corps, 31,530 guns and mortars, 1,908 tanks and self-propelled artillery installations, 2,364 combat aircraft.

Retained Soviet bridgeheads on the right bank of the Dnieper were the starting areas for the concentration of troops, military equipment, materiel needed for the impending offensive. In early December 1943, the Soviets began to regroup the troops. At night rifle divisions, artillery and tank units marched to the front line. A continuous stream of moving vehicles with weapons, military equipment, ammunition and food arrived to the front.

== The territory of the right-bank Ukraine ==
The hostilities that unfolded in January-May 1944 in the southern section of the Soviet-German front covered a vast territory from the [[Dnieper]] to the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], from [[Polesia]] to the [[Black Sea]], including the [[right-bank Ukraine]], [[Western Ukraine]], [[Southern Ukraine]], [[Crimea]], part of [[Moldova]] and [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Right-bank Ukraine makes up more than half of the territory of all Ukraine and is of extreme economic importance. There are many large administrative and industrial centers such as [[Odessa]], [[Dnipro|Dnepropetrovsk]], [[Kryvyi Rih|Krivoy Rog]], [[Mykolaiv|Nikolaev]], [[Kropyvnytskyi|Kirovograd]], [[Vinnytsia|Vinnitsa]].

In the areas of the right-bank Ukraine, important industries were developed: iron ore (Krivoy Rog), manganese ore (Nikopol), oil extracting (Drohobych district), shipbuilding (Nikolaev), sugar, textile and other industries.&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Wheat, sugar beet, maize, rye, and barley are grown on the territory of the right-bank Ukraine. Cattle breeding is well developed in the Polesie regions, while horticulture is well developed in the central and southern regions. Crimea is a horticulture and viticulture district. The iron ore development of the Kerch Peninsula is important. In the Crimea there are 4 large ports: [[Sevastopol]], [[Feodosia|Feodosiya]], [[Kerch]], [[Yevpatoria]].

The capture of the right-bank Ukraine and the Crimea would open the doors for the Red Army troops to Southern [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Romania]] and the [[Balkans]]. It would also ensure the domination of the Soviet [[Black Sea Fleet]] in the Central and Western parts of the [[Black Sea]].

== Terrain and weather ==
The terrain in the combat areas was very diverse, ranging from vast wooded [[Swamp|swampy]] areas, endless [[Steppe|steppes]], to mountains and hills. On the right-bank Ukraine there are many rivers flowing mainly from the northwest to the southeast: for example, the [[Dnieper]], [[Southern Bug]], [[Inhulets River|Ingulets]], [[Dniester]], [[Prut]] and [[Siret (river)|Siret]]. Those rivers were serious natural barriers for the advancing [[Red Army]] troops that could be used by the Germans to organize defense. In general, the vast territory of the right-bank Ukraine allowed the Soviets to launch broad offensive operations and use all types of troops, including large armored and mechanized formations.

In 1944, spring in the Ukraine was early. Already in January 1944, melting of the snow began, the wet snow was soon followed by rain. In February, there were frosts in places, but not for long, then it got warmer again. The rivers became flooded, the roads became very muddy, the terrain outside roads became difficult to pass. All this sharply reduced the maneuverability of the troops of both sides, especially the Soviet troops that were on continuous advance with supply bases being over 300 km behind. It also limited the use of tanks and artillery, and hampered the supply of food, fuel and ammunition. In connection with the spring thaw, most of the ground airfields were no longer usable, which complicated the deployment and usage of aviation.

However, much to the disappointment of the Germans, the Red Army continued their offensives, becoming the only force in the history of warfare that was able to launch large-scale and successful offensives in the conditions of the spring mud ([[rasputitsa]]) and amid flooded rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==

=== First phase ===
The initial phase of the offensive, it lasted from 24 December 1943, to 29 February 1944. It included the following operations:

*Zhitomir–Berdichev Offensive (24 December 1943 – 14 January 1944);&lt;ref name="Bellamymap"/&gt;

====Zhitomir–Berdichev Offensive====
{{Main article|Zhitomir–Berdichev Offensive}}
The offensive was launched on December 24, 1943, by General [[Nikolai Vatutin]]'s 1st Ukrainian Front, with attacks against the German 4th Panzer Army, to the west and south-west of Kiev.&lt;ref name="Pimlot332"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Willmott371"&gt;Willmott, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt; Manstein attempted to counter the attack with a flank attack by the Fourth Panzer Army, while simultaneously requesting reinforcements and permission to shorten the line by withdrawing.&lt;ref name="Ziemke218"&gt;Ziemke, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;  Vatutin's offensive continued west, and the Fortieth Army passed south of Fastov.&lt;ref name="Ziemke220"&gt;Ziemke, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Manstein's attempted counterattack failed when [[Erhard Raus]], the commander of the Fourth Panzer Army, said that he did not have time to organize for an offensive and preferred to attempt to directly stop the attacking troops.&lt;ref name="Ziemke220"/&gt; On December 27, Manstein directly asked Hitler for permission to pull back his troops, but he was ordered to hold.&lt;ref name="Pimlot332"/&gt;Soviet troops attacked [[Kazatin]] on December 28. After several hours of confused fighting, Soviet forces captured the town later that day.&lt;ref name="Ziemke220" /&gt; [[Korosten]] fell on December 29, and Zhitomir followed on December 31.&lt;ref name="Pimlot332" /&gt; The Fourth Panzer Army began to fall apart, as a 35-mile gap opened around Zhitomir between its southern flank and the XIII Corps.&lt;ref name="Ziemke222"&gt;Ziemke, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Another gap developed between the XXXXII Corps and VII Corps.&lt;ref name="Ziemke222" /&gt; Raus advised Manstein to forgo attempts to close the gaps, and instead focus on keeping the remaining Corps intact.&lt;ref name="Ziemke222" /&gt; Around the time of the new year, however, Soviet forces began an attempt to encircle German forces, particularly the XIII, XXXXVIII, and XXIV Panzer Corps.&lt;ref name="Ziemke222" /&gt; As attacks on areas surrounding [[Berdichev]] continued, the XIII Corps was reduced to the strength of one infantry regiment.&lt;ref name="Ziemke223"&gt;Ziemke, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; A gap of almost 70 miles was opened between Fourth Panzer Army and the First Panzer Army.&lt;ref name="Ziemke223" /&gt; Planned German reinforcements were stopped by the Soviet [[#Kirovograd Offensive|Kirovograd Offensive]].&lt;ref name="Ziemke223" /&gt;

In the course of the operation the Soviets achieved notable success. Having advanced to a depth of 80 to 200 km, they almost completely cleared the German forces from the [[Kiev Oblast|Kiev]] and [[Zhytomyr Oblast|Zhytomyr]] regions, a number of districts of the [[Vinnytsia Oblast|Vinnitsa]] and [[Rivne Oblast|Rovno]] regions.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets now dangerously hanged from the north over Army Group South, while the [[27th Army (Soviet Union)|27th]] and [[40th Army (Soviet Union)|40th]] Armies had deeply enveloped the German troops that continued to hold the right bank of the [[Dnieper]] in the area of Kanev. This created the conditions for the subsequent [[Battle of the Korsun–Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun-Schevchenkovsky Operation]].

The blow of the 1st Ukrainian Front was struck at the most sensitive place of Army Group South - its northern flank, which threatened to cut off its main forces from the paths leading to Germany. The [[1st Panzer Army|1st]] and [[4th Panzer Army|4th]] Panzer Armies operating in the front line had suffered serious losses- the 143rd and 147th Reserve Infantry Divisions were disbanded, the [[68th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|68th Infantry Division]] due to heavy losses was withdrawn from the front-line and sent to Poland for extensive refits, while [[8th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|8th Panzer Division]], [[20th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|20th Panzer-Grenadier Division]], [[112th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|112th]], [[291st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|291st]] and 340th Infantry Divisions were halved in strength.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; All told, 8 Wehrmacht divisions were either destroyed or halved in strength.

To close the gaps in their defense and to stop the Soviet offensive on this sector, the Germans had to urgently transfer 12 divisions of the [[1st Panzer Army]] from the southern Ukraine to this area. The reserves turned out to be almost completely spent, which affected the further course of operations. To parry the subsequent attacks of the Soviet troops, the German command was forced to deploy troops from [[Western Europe]], as well as from [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

====Kirovograd Offensive====
General [[Ivan Konev]]'s 2nd Ukrainian Front next joined the fray by launching the [[Kirovograd Offensive]] on January 5, 1944.&lt;ref name="Pimlot332"/&gt; One of the first accomplishments was to stop III Panzer Corps' attempted reinforcement of the Fourth Panzer Army, which was simultaneously being attacked by Vatutin's Front in the [[#Zhitomir–Berdichev Offensive|Zhitomir–Berdichev Offensive]].&lt;ref name="Ziemke223"/&gt; At this point, Manstein flew to Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia to ask permission to withdraw, but was again refused.&lt;ref name="Pimlot332"/&gt;

As a result of the Kirovograd operation, the troops of the [[Steppe Front|2nd Ukrainian Front]] pushed back the Germans from the Dnieper 40–50km. During intense battles, the German [[8th Army (Wehrmacht)|8th Army]] suffered significant losses- the [[167th Volksgrenadier Division (Wehrmacht)|167th Infantry Division]] was disbanded due to heavy losses, while the [[10th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer-Grenadier Division]], [[106th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|106th]], 282nd and [[376th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|376th]] infantry divisions suffered 50 to 75% losses in personnel and lost a large number of equipment.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important result of the operation was the liberation of [[Kropyvnytskyi|Kirovograd]] - a major stronghold and an important road junction, which broke the stability of the defense of the 8th German Army.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; The capture of Kirovograd threatened from the south the flanks of German forces which were located around [[Korsun-Shevchenkivskyi|Korsun-Schevchenkovsky]]. In turn, the Kirovograd Operation, alongside the neighboring Zhitomir-Berdichev Operation, created the conditions for the subsequent [[Battle of the Korsun–Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun-Schevchenkovsky Operation]].

====Korsun–Shevchenkovsky Offensive====
{{Main article|Korsun–Shevchenkovsky Offensive}}
[[File:Sovietgunners.jpg|thumb|alt=A large gun trapped in mud. Several men in long, heavy coats are pushing on it trying to get it free.|The spring thaw created very muddy conditions which encumbered both armies.]]
The main effort was to the south, where the [[Korsun–Shevchenkovsky Offensive]] was launched on January 24. After a massive bombardment,&lt;ref name="Pimlot332" /&gt; 2nd Ukrainian Front's 4th Guards and 53rd Armies attacked to the south of the Korsun bulge, and were joined the next day by the 5th Guards Tank Army. They broke through and easily repelled a German counter-attack.&lt;ref name="Pimlot332" /&gt; On January 26, 1st Ukrainian Front dispatched 6th Guards Tank Army from the north, which met up with the forces advancing from the south on January 28, encircling about 60,000 Germans in [[XI Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XI]] and [[XXXXII Army Corps (Germany)|XXXXII Army Corps]] around Korsun, in a pocket named "Little Stalingrad" due to the ferocity of the fighting in it.&lt;ref name="Pimlot332" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Willmott372"&gt;Willmott, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, twenty-seven Soviet divisions were assigned to destroy the pocket.&lt;ref name="Bellamy606"&gt;Bellamy, p. 606&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet efforts, however, were hindered by the onset of an early thaw, which made the ground muddy.&lt;ref name="Bellamy606" /&gt; On February 4 Manstein dispatched [[Hans Hube]], commanding the [[1st Panzer Army]],&lt;ref name="Bellamy606" /&gt; including [[XLVII Panzer Corps (Germany)|XLVII]] and [[III Panzer Corps (Germany)|III Panzer Corps]] to assist in a breakout attempt. XLVII Panzer Corps attacked from the south-east, while III Panzer Corps attacked the west, but they were both bogged down by the mud.&lt;ref name="Pimlot332" /&gt; Zhukov issued a surrender demand to the forces trapped in the pocket on February 8, but was turned down.&lt;ref name="Bellamy606" /&gt; III Panzer Corps was eventually, after a hard battle of attrition, able to reach [[Lysyanka]], close to the trapped forces,&lt;ref name="Pimlot332" /&gt; and German forces in the pocket attempted to break out, with a majority perhaps escaping, albeit with heavy losses in abandoned wounded and heavy equipment. Running out of supplies and harried by airstrikes and advancing ground forces, [[Wilhelm Stemmermann]], commander of the trapped forces, decided to attempt a final break-out on the night of February 16–17.&lt;ref name="Pimlot332" /&gt; The Soviets took approximately 15,000 prisoners, and killed at least 10,000 Germans, including Stemmermann. The battle was waged under incredibly brutal conditions, with Russian POWs shot by the Germans during the retreat, and Konev admitted to allowing his cavalry to massacre troops attempting surrender with upraised hands.

====Rovno–Lutsk Offensive====
[[File:Wreckedtruckserickson.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Many destroyed or damaged trucks scattered around a field. Snow and dirt cover everything.|Some of the destroyed German equipment following the attempt to break out from Korsun.]]
Vatutin's forces continued attacking on the right flank, coming near to the important supply centers of [[Lviv|Lvov]] and [[Ternopil|Ternopol]] in the [[Rovno–Lutsk Offensive]],&lt;ref name="Willmott371"/&gt; which opened a 110-mile gap between Army Group South and [[Army Group Center]], which was stationed to the north.&lt;ref name="Willmott371"/&gt;

====Nikopol–Krivoi Rog Offensive====
{{Main article|Nikopol–Krivoi Rog Offensive}}

The Nikopol–Krivoi Rog Offensive was meanwhile launched by 3rd Ukrainian Front to the south against forces in [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist]]'s [[Army Group A]], and proceeded slowly at first.&lt;ref name="Keegan476"&gt;Keegan, p. 476.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it eventually destroyed the salient projecting around Kryvyi Rih and Nikopol, costing the Germans the important mining operations there as well as nearly encircling the defenders.&lt;ref name="Keegan476" /&gt;

While the offensive appeared to slow down in late February, the Soviets were preparing for the second phase of the offensive, soon to be launched on an even larger scale.&lt;ref name="Willmott372"/&gt;

===Second phase===
These operations were included in the second phase by Soviet planners:

*Proskurov–Chernovtsy Offensive (4 March 1944 – 17 April 1944);&lt;ref name="Bellamymap"/&gt;
*[[Uman–Botoşani Offensive]] (5 March 1944 – 17 April 1944);{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
*[[Bereznegovatoye–Snigirevka Offensive]] (6–18 March 1944);{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
*Polesskoe Offensive (15–5 April 1944);{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} and
*Odessa Offensive (26 March 1944 – 14 April 1944).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

====Uman–Botoshany Offensive====
{{Main article|Uman–Botoşani Offensive}}
On March 5 Koniev launched the [[Uman–Botoshany Offensive]],&lt;ref name="Pimlot332"/&gt; advancing rapidly and soon cutting off the supply line for First Panzer Army by capturing [[Chortkiv|Chortkov]] on March 23.&lt;ref name="Pimlot332"/&gt; On March 10, the 2nd Ukrainian Front destroyed two Panzer Corps by capturing them at the fall of [[Uman]].&lt;ref name="Willmott373"/&gt;

====Proskurov–Chernovtsy Offensive====
{{Main article|Kamenets-Podolsky pocket}}
This was the biggest and most important Soviet operation of the Dnieper-Carpathian Offensive. After the slackening of the Soviet effort at the end of February, the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|OKH]], the headquarters for the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], believed any further offensive effort in that sector unlikely.&lt;ref name="Willmott372"/&gt; However, the Soviets were secretly preparing an even greater offensive, bringing in all six tank armies stationed in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Willmott374"&gt;Willmott, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet deception measures were successful and most Germans were surprised when, on March 4, the 1st Ukrainian Front–commanded by Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] after Vatutin's death–launched the [[Proskurov–Chernovtsy Offensive]] (see [[Kamenets-Podolsky pocket]]), with a fierce artillery barrage.&lt;ref name="Pimlot332"/&gt; Due to the extremely muddy conditions, it was hard for the defending Germans to remain mobile, but the Soviet forces had adequate supplies of tracked tanks and trucks, giving them the advantage.&lt;ref name="Pimlot332"/&gt;

====Bereznegovatoye–Snigirevka Offensive====
Malinovsky joined with the [[Bereznegovatoye–Snigirevka Offensive]] the next day,&lt;ref name="Pimlot332"/&gt; while Tolbukin was detached to begin preparations for the [[Crimean Offensive (1944)|Crimean Offensive]].&lt;ref&gt;Pimlott, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; These Fronts advanced rapidly, while Konev moved to cut off the withdrawal of the First Panzer Army. The First Panzer Army, now commanded by [[Hans Hube]], was entirely encircled by March 28.&lt;ref name="Pimlot332"/&gt; During the encirclement, Eric von Manstein flew to Hitler's headquarters and asked him to revoke his directive that required all encircled formations to form "fortresses" where they were.&lt;ref name="Pimlott333"&gt;Pimlott, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; He was successful, and received [[II SS Panzer Corps]] as reinforcements, the first transfer of forces to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] at the expense of the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] since Hitler's Führer Directive 51.&lt;ref name="Willmott374"/&gt; On March 30, Hube's forces struck out of the pocket, and, because Soviet [[military intelligence]] was unaware of the arrival of II Panzer Corps&lt;ref name="Willmott374"/&gt; and he moved west, instead of south as Soviet commanders were expecting,&lt;ref name="Pimlott333"/&gt; he was successful, and, by April 10, Hube's forces had met up with the Fourth Panzer Army.&lt;ref name="Pimlott333"/&gt; Despite this small success, Hitler blamed his generals for the overall strategic success of Soviet forces, fired the commanders of Army Group South and Army Group A (von Manstein and von Kleist, respectively), replaced them with [[Walter Model]] and [[Ferdinand Schörner]], and renamed them Army Groups [[Army Group North Ukraine|North]] and [[Army Group South Ukraine|South Ukraine]], indicating his plans to recapture this territory.&lt;ref name="Hart148"&gt;Liddell Hart, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polesskoe Offensive====
Meanwhile, towards the south, the 3rd Ukrainian Front was advancing on Odessa and into the Romanian-administered [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]].&lt;ref name="Pimlott333"/&gt; After three days of heavy fighting, his spearheading Eight Guards Army had advanced only {{convert|5|mi|km}}, but it had broken the crust of Karl-Adolf Hollidt's Sixth Army, and quickly advanced {{convert|25|mi|km}} towards [[Novyi Buh]], nearly encircling the defenders.&lt;ref name="Pimlott333"/&gt; Despite Hitler's orders forbidding retreat, German forces fell back to the [[Southern Bug|Bug River]] by March 11. The same day, Hollidt managed to break out from his encirclement — primarily because Malinovsky had divided his forces at [[Mykolaiv]] (Nikolaev)&lt;ref name="Pimlott333"/&gt; — and was able to improvise a defensive line on the Bug by March 21. However, he had lost Hitler's confidence, and was sacked, to be replaced with [[Maximilian de Angelis]].&lt;ref name="Pimlott333"/&gt; On March 28, pressed hard all over the line, German troops began to fall back from the Bug.&lt;ref name="Pimlott333"/&gt;

====Odessa Offensive====
[[File:Sov Odessa 44.jpg|thumb|250px|Soviet [[T-34]] tanks near Odessa, April 1944.]]
By March 25, the Prut had fallen and the 3rd Ukrainian Front was dispatched to secure [[Odessa]].&lt;ref name="Willmott373"&gt;Willmott, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, [[Vasili Chuikov]]'s Eighth Guards Army and Forty-Sixty Army attacked through a blizzard&lt;ref name="Pimlott333"/&gt; and, by April 6, had driven the defenders past the [[Dniester|Dniester River]] and isolated [[Odessa]].&lt;ref name="Pimlott333"/&gt; Odessa capitulated on April 10, and Soviet troops began entering [[Romania]] proper.&lt;ref name="Pimlott333"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The battles on the right-bank Ukraine and in the [[Crimean offensive|Crimea]] were the most important events of the 1944 winter-spring campaign on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and were of the greatest political, economic and strategic importance.&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between late December 1943- early May 1944, the [[Red Army]] troops defeated the strongest German force on the territory of the [[Right-bank Ukraine|right-bank]], [[Western Ukraine|western]] and [[southern Ukraine]], which was [[Army Group South]] and [[Army Group A]], and forced the battered army groups to retreat 250–450 km to the west, into eastern [[Poland]] ([[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]) and [[Romania]].

The defeat of [[Army Group South]] and [[Army Group A]], and the clearing of the German forces from the Right-Bank Ukraine and [[Crimea]] had radically changed the strategic situation in the south. With the Red Army capturing the [[Lviv|Lvov]]-[[Odessa]] railway, the main supply lifeline of Army Group South, and reaching the [[Carpathian Mountains]], the front of Army Group South was split into two parts- north and south of the Carpathians. The northern portion was pushed back into [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] ([[Poland]]), while the southern portion was pushed back into [[Romania]]. 

The northern portion was renamed to [[Army Group North Ukraine]], while the southern portion to [[Army Group South Ukraine]], which was effective from 5 April 1944, although very little of Ukraine remained in German hands. As a result of this split, the connection between these two new army groups had been broken. Now, the southern group of German forces would have to use the long roundabout route through the [[Balkans]], with all of the supplies being rerouted over the [[Romania|Romanian]] railroads, which were in poor condition.

For the German forces deployed in the Ukraine, the personnel losses were significant. During the campaign, 9 infantry and 1 Luftwaffe field division were destroyed&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;, while 7 panzer and panzergrenadier, 1 parachute, and 2 infantry divisions were so badly damaged that they were withdrawn from the front and sent to the West for extensive reﬁts.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Liedtke (2015). Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all the rest of the divisions were heavily damaged as well, suffering at least 50% losses in personnel, while some were left with just remnants of their troops.&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, 18 of the 39 divisions belonging to [[Army Group A]] were categorized as [[Kampfgruppe|Kampfgruppen]], or battle groups, meaning that the divisions were so depleted as to actually be the equivalent of little more than reinforced regiments.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Liedtke (2015). Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to German General [[Kurt von Tippelskirch]], the defeat of the German forces on the [[Right-bank Ukraine|Right-Bank Ukraine]] was the biggest since Stalingrad:&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; "''Since the time when the German armies followed a thorny path from the [[Volga River|Volga]] and the [[Caucasus]], retreating to the [[Dnieper]], this was their biggest defeat. Even such skilled generals as [[Erich von Manstein|Manstein]] and [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Kleist]] could not save the German troops.''"

In [[Crimea]], during the April-May 1944 [[Crimean offensive|Crimean Offensive]], the German [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th Army]] was annihilated. The 5 German and 7 Romanian divisions that were part of it were largely destroyed.

In reaction to the German defeat, Hitler took repressive measures against the senior command. The commander of [[Army Group South]] [[Erich von Manstein]] and the commander of [[Army Group A]] [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]] were dismissed by [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and replaced by [[Walter Model|Walther Model]] and [[Ferdinand Schörner]] respectively. Many commanders of corps, divisions and commandants of the “fortresses” were removed from their posts and put on trial. Thousands of middle and junior officers have been convicted by military courts.

With a crushing blows between January and May 1944, the Red Army thwarted the intentions of the German command to wage a protracted defensive war and overturned all attempts by the Germans to create a stable defense on the southern part of the Soviet-German front.

The huge losses of the German troops significantly shook the stability of the German defenses on the entire Soviet-German front, weakening the forces of the neighboring [[Army Group Centre|Army Group Center]], as well as weakening the [[OB West|German forces stationed in France]] prior to the [[Normandy landings|opening of the second front in Europe]]. 

The Dnieper-Carpathian Offensive had a major impact upon the future course of events during the summer of 1944 in the East and West.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Liedtke (2015). Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, the battle turned out to be a huge bloodsucker that absorbed huge amounts of German resources from across [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Poland]], [[Balkans]] and [[Army Group Centre|Army Group Center]]. All told, between January-May 1944, a total of 34 divisions,&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt; 550,000 men and 853 tanks, assault guns, and self-propelled anti-tank guns&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; were transferred to the Ukraine from across [[Europe]] and Army Group Center. 

To deal with the crises and to stabilize the front-lines in the [[Western Ukraine]], the [[Wehrmacht]] was forced to redirect huge amounts of men, equipment, and reinforcements to that area. These resources were desperately necessary to prepare the forces in France for the upcoming Allied invasion and whose redirection critically weakened Army Group Center. 

This Soviet offensive also ended any prospects the Germans may had about creating a sizable strategic reserve, since most of the German reserves were exhausted in this battle.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Liedtke (2015). Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944. The Journal of Slavic Military Studies, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, this set the Wehrmacht up for a new series of even greater disasters in the summer of 1944. While German defeat was inevitable at this point in the war, the Soviet success during this offensive had sped up the process of the eventual Allied victory and saved the Allies a great deal of time, blood, and treasure. 

The Soviet success during this offensive created the conditions for a series of major offensives in the summer of 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Грылев А.Н. Днепр-Карпаты-Крым. Освобождение Правобережной Украины и Крыма в 1944 году. Москва: Наука, 1970, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; First, conditions were created to develop attacks in the [[Lublin]] direction to the flank and rear of [[Army Group Centre|Army Group Center]], which were accomplished during the [[Lublin–Brest Offensive|Lublin-Brest Offensive]]. Secondly, conditions were created to develop attack in the [[Lviv|Lvov]] direction and towards eastern [[Poland]], which was accomplished during the [[Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive|Lvov-Sandomierz Operation]]. Thirdly, conditions were created to develop attack deeper into [[Romania]] and the [[Balkans]], which were accomplished during the [[Jassy–Kishinev Offensive|Jassy–Kishinev Operation]]. 

The operation, along with the [[Crimean Offensive (1944)|Crimean Offensive]], resulted in very heavy casualties for the unmotorized Romanian troops stationed in Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Pimlott333" /&gt; The heavy casualties and the proximity of Soviet forces to the Romanian border were the primary motivations for Romanian leaders when they began secret peace talks in Moscow soon after the completion of the offensive.&lt;ref name="Pimlott333" /&gt;

===Territory recaptured===
In the course of the operation the [[Vinnytsia Oblast|Vinnytsia]] (Vinnitsa), [[Volyn Oblast|Volyn]], [[Zhytomyr Oblast|Zhytomyr]] (Zhytomir), [[Kiev Oblast|Kiev]], [[Kirovohrad Oblast|Kirovohrad]], [[Rivne Oblast|Rivne]] (Rovno), [[Khmelnytskyi Oblast|Khmelnytskyi]] (Khmelnitskiy) and parts of [[Poltava Oblast|Poltava oblasts]], and the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] were taken by the Red Army, an area of some 204,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Modern view===
During the Cold War the operation was not very widely recognized for the significant strategic victory that it really is in Western history.&lt;ref name="Willmott374"/&gt;  After the end of World War II, some of the commanders involved were disgraced, and Stalin widely eliminated most references of the operation. Also, under the influence of German historiography and biographies, Western historians until the end of the [[Cold War]] focused on the German successes in the extrication of the 1st Panzer Army instead of the Soviet operations themselves that liberated much of Ukraine.&lt;ref name="Willmott374"/&gt;
