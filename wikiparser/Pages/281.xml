{{Campaignbox Polish September Campaign}}
The '''Battle of Husynne''' ({{lang-pl|bitwa pod Husynnem}}) was an armed engagement fought on 24 September 1939 between the [[Polish Army]] and the [[Red Army]] during the Nazi and Soviet [[invasion of Poland]].{{sfn|Rąkowski|pp=227-228}} The battle took place in the vicinity of [[Husynne, Hrubieszów County|Husynne]] manor, some {{convert|7|km|mi}} to the north east of the town of [[Hrubieszów]].{{sfn|Rąkowski|pp=227-228}}{{sfn|Szawłowski|p=224}} In the effect of a swift [[cavalry charge]], a Polish improvised cavalry unit broke through Soviet infantry lines, but were then decimated by Soviet tanks.

On 23 September the [[8th Estonian Rifle Corps|8th Rifle Corps]] of the Red Army crossed the [[Bug River]] near Hrubieszów. The unit, consisting of [[44th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|44th]] and [[81st Rifle Division]]s, captured the town and headed westwards. It was met by an improvised Polish cavalry unit operating in the area.{{sfn|Szawłowski|p=224}} The Polish force, commanded by Major [[Witold Radziulewicz]] (retired),{{sfn|Cygan|p=119}} was composed of a [[March battalion|march squadron]] of the [[14th Regiment of Jazlowiec Uhlans]], reinforced by a squadron of mobilised [[mounted police]] from Warsaw and a weakened battalion of [[CBRN defense|chemical defence]] troops,{{sfn|Rąkowski|pp=227-228}} some 1500 men strong and armed with 36 [[81 mm moździerz piechoty wz. 31|81 mm wz. 31 mortars]] commanded by Capt. Józef Cwynar.{{sfn|Cygan|p=119}}

The Polish commander was heading southwards, towards the border with Hungary and Romania. Radziulewicz decided to break through the ranks of Soviet infantry and continue his march. The Soviet infantry started an assault of the Polish formation in an open field, but were met by a counter-charge of 400 Polish policemen, supported by the sudden bombardment of the mortar battery.{{sfn|Rąkowski|pp=227-228}} The sudden counterattack caused panic in the Soviet lines and the Soviet infantry started a hasty retreat.{{sfn|Rąkowski|pp=227-228}} However, soon afterwards a Soviet tank detachment appeared from the Bug River valley. After a brief fight, the Poles were overwhelmed, surrounded and forced to surrender{{sfn|Rąkowski|pp=227-228}} after the mortars had used up all the ammunition supplies.{{sfn|Cygan|p=119}}

In the effect of the bloody engagement the Soviets lost several hundred killed and wounded.{{sfn|Rąkowski|pp=227-228}} The Polish side lost 18 killed and 139 wounded. After the battle at least 25 Polish prisoners of war were murdered by the Soviets, they are buried in a small war cemetery in [[Rogalin, Lublin Voivodeship|Rogalin]] and in Husynne.{{sfn|Rąkowski|pp=227-228}}{{sfn|Szawłowski|p=377}}
