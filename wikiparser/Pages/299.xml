The '''First Battle of Smolensk''' ({{lang-de|Kesselschlacht bei Smolensk}} "[[Encirclement|Cauldron-battle]] at Smolensk"; {{Lang-ru|Смоленская стратегическая оборонительная операция}}, ''Smolenskaya strategicheskaya oboronitelnaya operatsiya'', "Smolensk strategic defensive operation") was a battle during the second phase of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, in [[World War II]]. It was fought around the city of [[Smolensk]] between 10 July and 10 September 1941, about {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Moscow. The [[Ostheer]] had advanced {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the [[USSR]] in the 18 days after the invasion on 22 June 1941.

The Soviet [[16th Army (Soviet Union)|16th]], [[19th Army (Soviet Union)|19th]] and the [[20th Army (Soviet Union)|20th armies]] were encircled and destroyed just to the south of Smolensk, though many of the men from the 19th and 20th armies managed to escape the pocket. Some historians have asserted that the cost to the Germans during this drawn-out battle and the delay in the drive towards Moscow led to the victory of the [[Red Army]] in the [[Battle of Moscow]] of December 1941.

==Background and planning==
On 22 June 1941, the [[Axis powers|Axis]] nations invaded the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]]. At first, the campaign met with spectacular success, as the surprised Soviet troops were not able to offer coordinated resistance. After three weeks of fighting, the Germans had reached the [[Western Dvina|Dvina]] and [[Dnieper]] rivers and planned for a resumption of the offensive. The main attack aimed at [[Moscow]], was carried out by [[Army Group Centre]] ([[Fedor von Bock]]). Its next target on the way to the Soviet capital was the city of [[Smolensk]]. The German plan called for the 2nd Panzer Group (later 2nd Panzer Army) to cross the Dnieper, closing on Smolensk from the south, while the 3rd Panzer Group (later 3rd Panzer Army) was to encircle the town from the north.{{sfn|Glantz|1995|p=58}}

After their initial defeats, the Red Army began to recover and took measures to ensure a more determined resistance and new defensive line was established around Smolensk. Stalin placed Field Marshal [[Semyon Timoshenko]] in command and transferred five armies out of the strategic reserve to Timoshenko. These armies had to conduct counter-offensives to blunt the German drive. The German high command ([[OKW]]) was not aware of the Soviet build-up until they encountered them on the battlefield.{{sfn|Glantz|1995|p=58}}{{sfn|Ziemke|1987|pp=29–30}}

Facing the Germans along the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] and [[Daugava River|Dvina]] rivers were stretches of the [[Stalin Line]] fortifications. The defenders were the [[13th Army (Soviet Union)|13th Army]] of the Western Front and the [[20th Army (Soviet Union)|20th Army]], [[21st Army (Soviet Union)|21st Army]] and the [[22nd Army (Soviet Union)|22nd Army]] of the Soviet Supreme Command ([[Stavka]]) Reserve. The [[19th Army (Soviet Union)|19th Army]], was forming up at [[Vitebsk]], while the 16th Army was arriving at Smolensk.{{sfn|Glantz|1995|pp=58–59}}{{sfn|Ziemke|1987|pp=29–30}}

In Soviet histories, the battles around Smolensk are divided into phases and operations to halt the German offensive and the [[Pincer movement|pincers]]

==The Operation==
Prior to the German attack, the Soviets launched a counter-offensive; on 6 July, the [[7th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|7th]] and [[5th Mechanised Corps (Soviet Union)|5th Mechanized Corps]] of the Soviet 20th Army attacked with about 1,500 tanks near [[Lepiel]]. The result was a disaster, as the offensive ran directly into the anti-tank defenses of the German [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th Panzer Division]] and the two Soviet mechanized corps were virtually wiped out.{{sfn|Glantz|2010|pp=70–79, 86}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-351-1427-21A, Russland, Panzer IV.jpg|thumb|German vehicle column near Vitebsk in July 1941]]
On 10 July, Guderian's 2nd Panzer Group began a surprise attack over the Dnieper, his forces overran the weak 13th Army and by 13 July, Guderian had passed [[Mogilev]], [[Siege of Mogilev|trapping]] several Soviet divisions. His spearhead unit, the [[29th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|29th Motorised Division]], was already within {{convert|18|km|abbr=on}} of Smolensk. The 3rd Panzer Group had attacked, with the 20th Panzer Division establishing a bridgehead on the eastern bank of the Dvina river, threatening Vitebsk. As both German panzer groups drove east, the [[16th Army (Soviet Union)|16th]], 19th and 20th armies faced the prospect of encirclement around Smolensk. From 11 July, the Soviets tried a series of concerted counter-attacks. The Soviet 19th Army and 20th Army struck at Vitebsk, while the 21st and the remnants of the 3rd Army attacked against the southern flank of 2nd Panzer Group near [[Bobruisk]].{{sfn|Glantz|1995|pp=58–59}}

Several other Soviet armies also attempted to counter-attack in the sectors of the German [[Army Group North]] and [[Army Group South]]. This effort was apparently part of an attempt to implement the Soviet prewar general defense plan. The Soviet attacks managed to slow the Germans but the results were so marginal that the Germans barely noticed them as a large coordinated defensive effort and the German offensive continued.{{sfn|Glantz|1995|p=59}}

[[File:Смоленск во время оккупации.jpg|thumb|left|German troops in Smolensk, 1941]]
Hoth's 3rd Panzer Group drove north and then east, parallel to Guderian's forces, taking [[Polotsk]] and Vitebsk. The 7th Panzer Division and [[20th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|20th Panzer Division]] reached the area east of Smolensk at [[Yartsevo, Smolensk Oblast|Yartsevo]] on July 15. At the same time, the 29th Motorized Division, supported by the [[17th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|17th Panzer Division]] broke into Smolensk, captured the city except for the suburbs and began a week of house-to-house fighting against counter-attacks by the 16th Army. Guderian expected that the offensive would continue towards Moscow as its main focus and sent the [[10th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|10th Panzer Division]] to the [[Desna River]] to establish a bridgehead on the east bank at [[Yelnya, Yelninsky District, Smolensk Oblast|Yelnya]] and cleared that as well by the 20th. This advanced bridgehead became the center of the [[Yelnya Offensive]], one of the first big coordinated Soviet counter-offensives of the war.{{sfn|Glantz|1995|pp=60–61}}

This objective was {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Dnepr and well clear of the objective of liquidating the armies trapped at Smolensk. Under [[Führer Directives|Fuhrer Directive 33]] issued on July 14, the main effort of the Wehrmacht was re-orientated away from Moscow towards a deep encirclement of Kiev in Ukraine and Bock was becoming impatient, wanting Guderian to strike north and link up with Hoth's Panzer Group so resistance in the city could be mopped up.{{sfn|Glantz|1995|pp=60–61}}{{sfn|Ziemke|1987|pp=32–33}}

[[File:RIAN archive 76 On the battlefield.jpg|thumb|Soviet soldiers of the Western Front's 20th Army fighting on the Dnieper bank to the west of Dorogobuzh.]]
On July 27, Bock held a conference at Novy Borisov, which was also attended by Commander-in-Chief [[Walther von Brauchitsch]], the head of the [[Oberkommando des Heeres]] (OKH), the Supreme High Command of the Wehrmacht. The generals were required to sit without an opportunity to comment, while a memorandum was read to them by one of Brauchitsch's aides, instructing them that they were to strictly follow Fuhrer Directive 33 and were under no circumstance to try to push further east. They were ordered to concentrate on mopping up, refurbishing equipment, restocking supplies and straightening the German front line, which had become more of an "S" shape, due to the advances of Guderian and Hoth. Coming away from this meeting, Hoth and Guderian were angry and frustrated. Guderian wrote in his journal that night that Hitler "preferred a plan by which small enemy forces were to be encircled and destroyed piecemeal and the enemy thus bled to death. All the officers who took part in the conference were of the opinion that this was incorrect". Whether or not this was true, it was this meeting that some have pointed to that marked a critical point where the Wehrmacht leadership broke trust with Hitler. After returning to his post, Guderian conspired with Hoth and Bock to "delay the implementation" of Directive 33, in defiance of the orders of the Fuhrer and OKH. Guderian hastily put together a plan of attack for his and Hoth's forces for August 1, the [[Roslavl-Novozybkov Offensive|Roslavl-Novozybkov Offensive Operation]].{{sfn|Clark|1965|pp=91–94}}

In the north, the 3rd Panzer Group was moving much more slowly. The terrain was swampy, made worse by rain and the Soviets were fought to escape the trap. On 18 July, the armored pincers of the two panzer groups came within {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} of closing the gap. Timoshenko put newly promoted [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]], who had just arrived from the Ukrainian front, in charge of assembling a stopgap force, which held the attack of the 7th Panzer Division and with continuous reinforcements, temporarily stabilized the situation. The open gap allowed Soviet units to escape that were then pressed into service, holding the gap open.{{sfn|Glantz|1995|pp=60–61}}{{sfn|Clark|1965|p=90}}

The Soviets transferred additional troops from newly formed armies into the region around Smolensk, namely the 29th, 30th, 28th, and 24th Armies. These newly built formations would, immediately upon arrival, start a heavy counter-attack against the German forces around the Smolensk area from 21 July on. This put a heavy strain on the overextended Panzer forces, which had to cover a large area around the perimeter. However, poor coordination and logistics on the part of the Soviets allowed the Germans to successfully defend against these offensive efforts, while continuing to close the encirclement. The Soviet attacks would last until 30 July, when the Germans finally repelled the last of them.{{sfn|Glantz|1995|pp=60–61}}{{sfn|Ziemke|1987|pp=32–33}}

Finally, on 27 July, the Germans were able to link up and close the pocket east of Smolensk, trapping large portions of 16th, 19th, and 20th Armies. Under the leadership of 20th Army, Soviet troops managed to break out of the pocket in a determined effort a few days later, assisted by the Soviet offensive efforts along the Smolensk front line. In the end, about 300,000 men were taken prisoner when the encirclement was re-established and the pocket eliminated.{{sfn|Glantz|2010|p=576}}{{sfn|Klink|1998|p=536}}{{sfn|Ziemke|1987|pp=29–32}}

==Aftermath==
{{Further information|Amersfoort concentration camp|German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|Rusthof cemetery}}

The Battle of Smolensk was another severe defeat for the Red Army in the opening phase of Operation Barbarossa. For the first time, the Soviets tried to implement a coordinated counter-attack against a large part of the front; although this counter-attack turned into a military disaster, the stiffening resistance showed that the Soviets were not yet defeated and that the [[Blitzkrieg]] towards Moscow was not going to be an easy undertaking. Dissent within the German high command and political leadership was exacerbated. The leaders of the General Staff, [[Franz Halder]] and Brauchitsch and commanders like Bock, Hoth and Guderian counselled against dispersing the German armoured units and to concentrate on Moscow. Hitler reiterated the lack of importance of Moscow and of strategic encirclements and ordered a concentration on economic targets such as [[Ukraine]], the [[Donets Basin]] and the [[Caucasus]], with more tactical encirclements to weaken the Soviets further. The German offensive effort became more fragmented, leading to the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|Battle of Kiev]] and the [[Battle of Uman]]. The battles were German victories but costly in time, men and equipment on their approach towards Moscow, allowing the Soviets time to prepare the defenses of the city.&lt;ref name="Evans2008AtWar"&gt;{{harvnb |Evans|2008| pp=198–199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Glantz|1995|p=62}}{{sfn|Glantz|2010|pp=576–578}}{{sfn|Klink|1998|pp=535–536}}{{sfn|Ziemke|1987|pp=32–33}}{{sfn|Clark|1965|p=96}}
