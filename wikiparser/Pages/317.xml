The '''Battle of Moscow''' was a military campaign that consisted of two periods of strategically significant fighting on a {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}} sector of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] during [[World War II]]. It took place between October 1941 and January 1942. The Soviet defensive effort frustrated [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s attack on [[Moscow]], the capital and largest city of the [[Soviet Union]]. Moscow was one of the primary [[Strategic goal (military)|military]] and political objectives for [[Axis forces]] in their [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]].

The German [[strategic offensive]], named '''Operation Typhoon''', called for two [[Pincer movement|pincer offensives]], one to the north of Moscow against the [[Kalinin Front]] by the [[3rd Panzer Army|3rd]] and [[4th Panzer Army|4th Panzer Armies]], simultaneously severing the [[Saint Petersburg–Moscow Railway|Moscow–Leningrad railway]], and another to the south of [[Moscow Oblast]] against the [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]] south of [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], by the [[2nd Panzer Army]], while the 4th Army advanced directly towards Moscow from the west.

Initially, the Soviet forces conducted a [[strategic defence]] of the Moscow [[Oblast]] by constructing three [[Defence in depth|defensive belts]], deploying newly raised [[Military reserve force|reserve armies]], and bringing troops from the [[Siberian Military District|Siberian]] and [[Far Eastern Military District]]s. As the German offensives were halted, a Soviet strategic [[counter-offensive]] and smaller-scale offensive operations forced the German armies back to the positions around the cities of [[Oryol]], [[Vyazma]] and [[Vitebsk]], and nearly surrounded three German armies.
It was a major setback for the Germans, and the end of the idea of a quick German victory in the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shirer |first1=William L. |title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich |pages=275–87 |chapter=24, Swedish (Book III)}}&lt;!-- data re this cite were transferred from a mal-formed cite to Shirer's great work -- it needs double checking--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the failed offensive, Field Marshal [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] was dismissed as supreme commander of the [[German Army (1935–1945)|German Army]], with Hitler replacing him in the position.

[[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion plan, called for the capture of Moscow within four months. On 22 June 1941, Axis forces invaded the Soviet Union, destroyed most of the [[Soviet Air Force]] on the ground, and advanced deep into Soviet territory using ''[[blitzkrieg]]'' tactics to destroy entire Soviet armies. The German [[Army Group North]] moved towards Leningrad, [[Army Group South]] took control of [[Ukraine]], and [[Army Group Centre]] advanced towards Moscow. By July 1941, Army Group Centre crossed the [[Dnieper River]], on the path to Moscow.{{sfn|Bellamy|2007|p=243}}

On 15 July 1941, German forces captured [[Smolensk]], an important stronghold on the road to Moscow.{{sfn|Bellamy|2007|p=240}}
At this stage, although Moscow was vulnerable, an offensive against the city would have exposed the German flanks. In part to address these risks, and to attempt to secure Ukraine's food and mineral resources, Hitler ordered the attack to turn north and south and eliminate Soviet forces at [[Leningrad]] and [[Kiev]].&lt;ref name="Wilt"&gt;Alan F. Wilt. Hitler's Late Summer Pause in 1941. ''Military Affairs'', Vol. 45, No. 4 (December 1981), pp.&amp;nbsp;187–91&lt;/ref&gt; This delayed the German advance on Moscow.&lt;ref name="Wilt"/&gt; When that advance resumed on 30 September 1941, German forces had been weakened, while the Soviets had raised new forces for the defence of the city.&lt;ref name="Wilt"/&gt;

==Initial German advance (30 September – 10 October)==

===Plans===
{{details|Battle of Moscow order of battle}}

For Hitler, the Soviet capital was secondary, and he believed the only way to bring the Soviet Union to its knees was to defeat it economically. He felt this could be accomplished by seizing the economic resources of Ukraine east of Kiev.{{sfn|Flitton|1994}} When [[Walther von Brauchitsch]], [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Army, supported a direct thrust to Moscow, he was told that "only ossified brains could think of such an idea".{{sfn|Flitton|1994}} [[Franz Halder]], head of the [[German General Staff|Army General Staff]], was also convinced that a drive to seize Moscow would be victorious after the German Army inflicted enough damage on the Soviet forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=David M. Glantz |last=Niepold |first=Gerd |chapter=Plan Barbarossa |page=67 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yg4V2momdSAC&amp;pg=PA67 |title=The Initial Period of War on the Eastern Front, 22 June – August 1941: Proceedings of the Fourth Art of War Symposium, Garmisch, FRG, October 1987 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1993 |isbn=978-0714633756 |volume=2 |series=Cass series on Soviet military theory and practice}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was shared by most within the German high command.{{sfn|Flitton|1994}} But Hitler overruled his generals in favor of pocketing the Soviet forces around Kiev in the south, followed by the seizure of Ukraine. The move was successful, resulting in the loss of nearly 700,000  Red Army personnel killed, captured, or wounded by 26 September, and further advances by Axis forces.{{sfn|Glantz|House|1995|p=293}}

With the end of summer, Hitler redirected his attention to Moscow and assigned Army Group Centre to this task. The forces committed to Operation Typhoon included three infantry armies (the [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|2nd]], [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th]], and [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Operacja "Tajfun"|last=Stahel|first=David|work=Książka i Wiedza|year=2014|isbn=978-83-05-136402|location=Warsaw|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;) supported by three ''Panzer'' (tank) Groups (the [[2nd Panzer Army|2nd]], [[3rd Panzer Army|3rd]] and [[4th Panzer Army|4th]]) and by the [[Luftwaffe]]{{'}}s [[Luftflotte 2|''Luftflotte'' 2]]. Up to two million German troops were committed to the operation, along with 1,000–2,470 tanks and assault guns and 14,000 guns. German aerial strength, however, had been severely reduced over the summer's campaign; the ''Luftwaffe'' had lost 1,603 aircraft destroyed and 1,028 damaged. ''Luftflotte'' 2&amp;nbsp;had only 549 serviceable machines, including 158 medium and dive-bombers and 172 fighters, available for Operation Typhoon.&lt;ref&gt;Bergstöm 2007, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The attack relied on standard ''blitzkrieg'' tactics, using ''Panzer'' groups rushing deep into Soviet formations and executing double-pincer movements, pocketing Red Army divisions and destroying them.&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, pp. 307–09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing the [[Wehrmacht]] were three Soviet fronts forming a defensive line based on the cities of [[Vyazma]] and [[Bryansk]], which barred the way to Moscow. The armies comprising these fronts had also been involved in heavy fighting. Still, it was a formidable concentration consisting of 1,250,000 men, 1,000 tanks and 7,600 guns. The [[Soviet Air Force]] ''(Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily'', VVS) had suffered appalling losses of some 7,500&lt;ref name=Hardesty61&gt;Hardesty, 1991, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; to 21,200&lt;ref&gt;Bergström 2007, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; aircraft. Extraordinary industrial achievements had begun to replace these, and at the outset of Typhoon the VVS could muster 936 aircraft, 578 of which were bombers.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström 2007, pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Soviet resistance along the Vyazma-Bryansk front was eliminated, German forces were to press east, encircling Moscow by outflanking it from the north and south. Continuous fighting had reduced their effectiveness, and logistical difficulties became more acute. General [[Guderian]], commander of the 2nd Panzer Army, wrote that some of his destroyed tanks had not been replaced, and there were fuel shortages at the start of the operation.&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battles of Vyazma and Bryansk===
''Further information: [[Battle of Bryansk (1941)]]''

The German attack went according to plan, with 4th Panzer Group pushing through the middle nearly unopposed and then splitting its mobile forces north to complete the encirclement of Vyazma with 3rd Panzer Group, and other units south to close the ring around Bryansk in conjunction with 2nd Panzer Group. The Soviet defenses, still under construction, were overrun, and spearheads of the 3rd and 4th Panzer Groups met at Vyazma on 10 October 1941.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark Chapter 8,"The Start of the Moscow Offensive", p. 156 (diagram)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GlantzVAB"&gt;Glantz, chapter 6, sub-ch. "Viaz'ma and Briansk", pp. 74 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Four Soviet armies (the [[19th Army (Soviet Union)|19th]], [[20th Army (Soviet Union)|20th]], [[24th Army (Soviet Union)|24th]] and [[32nd Army (Soviet Union)|32nd]]) were encircled in a large pocket just west of the city.&lt;ref name="Vasilevsky139"&gt;Vasilevsky, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map Operation Typhoon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|German offensives during Operation Typhoon]]

The encircled Soviet forces continued to fight, and the Wehrmacht had to employ 28 divisions to eliminate them, using troops which could have supported the offensive towards Moscow. The remnants of the Soviet [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western]] and [[Reserve Front]]s retreated and manned new defensive lines around Mozhaisk.&lt;ref name="Vasilevsky139"/&gt; Although losses were high, some of the encircled units escaped in small groups, ranging in size from platoons to full rifle divisions.&lt;ref name="GlantzVAB"/&gt; Soviet resistance near Vyazma also provided time for the Soviet high command to reinforce the four armies defending Moscow (the [[5th Red Banner Army|5th]], [[16th Army (Soviet Union)|16th]], [[43rd Army (Soviet Union)|43rd]] and [[49th Army (Soviet Union)|49th]] Armies). Three rifle and two tank divisions were transferred from East Siberia with more to follow.&lt;ref name="Vasilevsky139"/&gt;

The weather began to change, hampering both sides. On 7&amp;nbsp;October, the first snow fell and quickly melted, turning roads and open areas into muddy quagmires, a phenomenon known as ''[[rasputitsa]]'' in Russia. German armored groups were greatly slowed, allowing Soviet forces to fall back and regroup.&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 165–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet forces were able to counterattack in some cases. For example, the [[4th Panzer Division]] fell into an ambush set by [[Dmitri Leliushenko]]'s hastily formed [[1st Guards Special Rifle Corps]], including [[Mikhail Katukov]]'s 4th Tank Brigade, near the city of [[Mtsensk]]. Newly built [[T-34]] tanks were concealed in the woods as German armor rolled past them; as a [[scratch team]] of Soviet infantry contained their advance, Soviet armor attacked from both flanks and savaged the German [[Panzer IV]] tanks. For the Wehrmacht, the shock of this defeat was so great that a special investigation was ordered.&lt;ref name="GlantzVAB"/&gt; Guderian and his troops discovered, to their dismay, that the Soviet T-34s were almost impervious to German tank guns. As the general wrote, "Our Panzer IV tanks with their short 75&amp;nbsp;mm guns could only explode a T-34 by hitting the engine from behind." Guderian also noted in his memoirs that "the Russians already learned a few things."&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David M. Glantz|title=When Titans Clashed|pages=80, 81}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Niklas Zetterling disputed the notion of a major German reversal at Mtsensk, noting that only a battlegroup from the 4th Panzer Division was engaged while most of the division was fighting elsewhere, that both sides withdrew from the battlefield after the fighting and that the Germans lost only six tanks destroyed and three damaged. For German commanders like [[Erich Hoepner|Hoepner]] and Bock, the action was inconsequential; their primary worry was resistance from within the pocket, not outside it.{{sfn|Zetterling|Frankson|2012|p=100}}

[[File:Wojska niemieckie na froncie moskiewskim (2-882).jpg|thumb|left|German armored column advances on the Moscow front, October 1941]]
Other counterattacks further slowed the German offensive. The 2nd Army, which was operating to the north of Guderian's forces with the aim of encircling the Bryansk Front, had come under strong Red Army pressure assisted by air support.&lt;ref name="Bergström_3"&gt;Bergström 2007, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to German assessments of the initial Soviet defeat, 673,000 soldiers had been captured by the Wehrmacht in both the Vyazma and Bryansk pockets,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Jukes, The Second World War – The Eastern Front 1941–1945, Osprey, 2002, {{ISBN|1-84176-391-8}}, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; although recent research suggests a lower—but still enormous—figure of 514,000 prisoners, reducing Soviet strength by 41%.&lt;ref&gt;Jukes, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Personnel losses of 499,001 (permanent as well as temporary) were calculated by the Soviet command.&lt;ref&gt;Glantz, When Titans Clashed p. 336 n15.&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 October, [[Otto Dietrich]] of the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|German Ministry of Propaganda]], quoting Hitler himself, forecast in a press conference the imminent destruction of the armies defending Moscow. As Hitler had never had to lie about a specific and verifiable military fact, Dietrich convinced foreign correspondents that the collapse of all Soviet resistance was perhaps hours away. German civilian morale—low since the start of Barbarossa—significantly improved, with rumors of soldiers home by Christmas and great riches from the future ''[[Lebensraum]]'' in the east.&lt;ref name="smith1942"&gt;{{cite book | title=Last Train from Berlin | publisher=Knopf | author=Smith, Howard K. | authorlink=Howard K.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B15500, Russland, Dorf vor Moskau.jpg|thumb|The mud of the [[rasputitsa]] before Moscow, November 1941]]
However, Red Army resistance had slowed the Wehrmacht. When the Germans arrived within sight of the Mozhaisk line west of Moscow on 10 October, they encountered another defensive barrier manned by new Soviet forces. That same day, Georgy Zhukov, who had been recalled from the [[Leningrad Front]] on 6&amp;nbsp;October, took charge of Moscow's defense and the combined [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western]] and [[Soviet Reserve Front|Reserve Fronts]], with Colonel General [[Ivan Konev]] as his deputy.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition (1970–1979). 2010 The Gale Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GeorgyZhukov&gt;{{Cite book |last=Zhukov |first=Georgy |title=Marshal of Victory, Volume II |publisher=Pen and Sword Books Ltd. |year=1974 |isbn=978-1781592915 |pages=7, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October, Zhukov ordered the concentration of all available forces on a strengthened Mozhaisk line, a move supported by General Vasilevsky of the General Staff.&lt;ref&gt;Zhukov, tome 2, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Luftwaffe'' still controlled the sky wherever it appeared, and ''Stuka'' and bomber groups flew 537 sorties, destroying some 440 vehicles and 150 artillery pieces.&lt;ref name="Plocher 1968 231"&gt;Plocher 1968, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergström 2007, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|KuibyshevEvacuation}}
On 15 October, Stalin ordered the evacuation of the Communist Party, the General Staff and various civil government offices from Moscow to Kuibyshev (now [[Samara, Russia|Samara]]), leaving only a limited number of officials behind. The evacuation caused panic among Muscovites. On 16–17 October, much of the civilian population tried to flee, mobbing the available trains and jamming the roads from the city. Despite all this, Stalin publicly remained in the Soviet capital, somewhat calming the fear and pandemonium.&lt;ref name="GlantzVAB"/&gt;

==Mozhaisk defense line (13–30 October)==
[[File:Battle of Moscow.jpg|thumb|left|Moscow women dig anti-tank trenches around their city in 1941]]
By 13 October 1941, the Wehrmacht had reached the Mozhaisk [[defense line]], a hastily constructed set of four lines of fortifications&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; protecting Moscow's western approaches which extended from [[Tver|Kalinin]] towards [[Volokolamsk]] and [[Kaluga]]. Despite recent reinforcements, only around 90,000 Soviet soldiers manned this line—far too few to stem the German advance.&lt;ref name="Jukes32"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhukov, tome 2, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the limited resources available, Zhukov decided to concentrate his forces at four critical points: the [[16th Army (Soviet Union)|16th Army]] under Lieutenant General [[Rokossovsky]] guarded [[Volokolamsk]], [[Mozhaisk]] was defended by [[Fifth Army (Soviet Union)|5th Army]] under Major General [[Leonid Govorov|Govorov]], the [[43rd Army (Soviet Union)|43rd Army]] of Major General [[Golubev]] defended [[Maloyaroslavets]], and the [[49th Army]] under Lieutenant General [[Zakharkin]] protected Kaluga.&lt;ref&gt;Marshal Zhukov's Greatest Battles p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire [[Soviet Western Front]]—nearly destroyed after its encirclement near Vyazma—was being recreated almost from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Zhukov, tome 2, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moscow itself was also hastily fortified. According to Zhukov, 250,000 women and teenagers worked building trenches and anti-tank moats around Moscow, moving almost three million cubic meters of earth with no mechanical help. Moscow's factories were hastily converted to military tasks: one automobile factory was turned into a [[submachine gun]] armory, a clock factory manufactured [[Land mine|mine]] detonators, the chocolate factory shifted to food production for the front, and automobile repair stations worked fixing damaged tanks and military vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Zhukov, tome 2, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these preparations, the capital was within striking distance of German tanks, with the Luftwaffe mounting large-scale air raids on the city. The air raids caused only limited damage because of extensive [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defenses]] and effective civilian fire brigades.&lt;ref&gt;Braithwaite, pp. 184–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 October 1941 (15 October, according to other sources), the Wehrmacht resumed its offensive. At first, the German forces attempted to bypass Soviet defenses by pushing northeast towards the weakly protected city of Kalinin and south towards Kaluga and [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], capturing all except Tula by 14 October. Encouraged by these initial successes, the Germans launched a frontal assault against the fortified line, taking Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets on 18 October, [[Naro-Fominsk]] on 21 October, and Volokolamsk on 27 October after intense fighting. Because of the increasing danger of flanking attacks, Zhukov was forced to fall back,&lt;ref name="GlantzVAB"/&gt; withdrawing his forces east of the [[Nara River (Russia)|Nara River]].&lt;ref&gt;Zhukov, tome 2, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the south, the Second Panzer Army initially advanced towards Tula with relative ease because the Mozhaisk defense line did not extend that far south and no significant concentrations of Soviet troops blocked their advance. However, bad weather, fuel problems, and damaged roads and bridges eventually slowed the German army, and Guderian did not reach the outskirts of Tula until 26 October.&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, pp. 329–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The German plan initially called for the rapid capture of Tula, followed by a pincer move around Moscow. The first attack, however, was repelled by the 50th Army and civilian volunteers on 29 October, after a fight within sight of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Zhukov, tome 2, pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 October, the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|German Army high command]] ordered a halt to all offensive operations until increasingly severe logistical problems were resolved and the ''[[rasputitsa]]'' subsided.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

==Wehrmacht advance towards Moscow (1 November – 5 December)==

===Wearing down===
By late October, the German forces were worn out, with only a third of their motor vehicles still functioning, infantry divisions at third- to half-strength, and serious logistics issues preventing the delivery of [[winter clothing|warm clothing]] and other winter equipment to the front. Even Hitler seemed to surrender to the idea of a long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks into such a large city without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|capture of Warsaw]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="GlantzTTG"&gt;Glantz, chapter 6, sub-ch. "To the Gates", pp. 80ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yuon RedSquare Parade 1941.jpg|thumb|left|[[1941 October Revolution Parade|Parade]] by Soviet troops on [[Red Square]], Friday, 7 November 1941, depicted in 1949 painting by [[Konstantin Yuon]] vividly demonstrating the symbolic significance of the event&lt;ref name=GeorgyZhukov/&gt;{{rp|31}}]]

To stiffen the resolve of the Red Army and boost civilian morale, Stalin ordered the [[1941 October Revolution Parade|traditional military parade]] on 7&amp;nbsp;November ([[October Revolution Day|Revolution Day]]) to be staged in [[Red Square]]. Soviet troops paraded past the Kremlin and then marched directly to the front. The parade carried a great symbolic significance by demonstrating the continued Soviet resolve, and was frequently invoked as such in the years to come. Despite this brave show, the Red Army's position remained precarious. Although 100,000 additional Soviet soldiers had reinforced [[Klin, Klinsky District, Moscow Oblast|Klin]] and [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], where renewed German offensives were expected, Soviet defenses remained relatively thin. Nevertheless, Stalin ordered several preemptive [[Counter-offensive|counteroffensives]] against German lines. These were launched despite protests from Zhukov, who pointed out the complete lack of reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Zhukov, tome 2, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wehrmacht repelled most of these counteroffensives, which squandered Soviet forces that could have been used for Moscow's defense. The only notable success of the offensive occurred west of Moscow near [[Aleksino]], where Soviet tanks inflicted heavy losses on the 4th Army because the Germans still lacked anti-tank weapons capable of damaging the new, well-armoured T-34 tanks.&lt;ref name="GlantzTTG"/&gt;



From 31 October to 13–15 November, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|Wehrmacht high command]] stood down while preparing to launch a second offensive towards Moscow. Although Army Group Centre still possessed considerable nominal strength, its fighting capabilities had thoroughly diminished because of wear and fatigue. While the Germans were aware of the continuous influx of Soviet reinforcements from the east as well as the presence of large reserves, given the tremendous Soviet casualties, they did not expect the Soviets to be able to mount a determined defense.&lt;ref&gt;Klink, pp. 574, 590–92&lt;/ref&gt; But in comparison to the situation in October, Soviet rifle divisions occupied a much stronger defensive position: a triple defensive ring surrounding the city and some remnants of the Mozhaisk line near Klin. Most of the Soviet field armies now had a multilayered defense, with at least two rifle divisions in second echelon positions. Artillery support and [[sapper]] teams were also concentrated along major roads that German troops were expected to use in their attacks. There were also many Soviet troops still available in reserve armies behind the front. Finally, Soviet troops—and especially officers—were now more experienced and better prepared for the offensive.&lt;ref name= "GlantzTTG"/&gt;

By 15 November 1941, the ground had finally frozen, solving the mud problem. The armored Wehrmacht spearheads, consisting of 51 divisions, could now advance, with the goal of encircling Moscow and linking up near the city of [[Noginsk]], east of the capital. To achieve this objective, the German Third and Fourth Panzer Groups needed to concentrate their forces between the [[Ivankovo Reservoir|Volga Reservoir]] and Mozhaysk, then proceed past the Soviet 30th Army to Klin and [[Solnechnogorsk]], encircling the capital from the north. In the south, the Second Panzer Army intended to bypass Tula, still held by the Red Army, and advance to [[Kashira]] and [[Kolomna]], linking up with the northern pincer at Noginsk. The German 4th Field Army in the centre were to "pin down the troops of the Western Front."&lt;ref name=GeorgyZhukov/&gt;{{rp|33, 42–43}}

===Failed pincer===
On 15 November 1941, German tank armies began their offensive towards [[Klin, Klinsky District, Moscow Oblast|Klin]], where no Soviet reserves were available because of Stalin's wish to attempt a counteroffensive at [[Volokolamsk]], which had forced the relocation of all available reserve forces further south. Initial German attacks split the front in two, separating the 16th Army from the 30th.&lt;ref name="GlantzTTG"/&gt; Several days of intense combat followed. [[Zhukov]] recalled in his memoirs that "The enemy, ignoring the casualties, was making frontal assaults, willing to get to Moscow by any means necessary."&lt;ref name="Zhukov28"&gt;Zhukov, tome 2, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Wehrmacht's efforts, the multi-layered defense reduced Soviet casualties as the Soviet 16th Army slowly retreated and constantly harassed the German divisions which were trying to make their way through the fortifications.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

The Third Panzer Army captured Klin after heavy fighting on 23 November, Solnechnogorsk as well by 24 November and Istra, Istransky District, Moscow Region, by 24/25 November. Soviet resistance was still strong, and the outcome of the battle was by no means certain. Reportedly, Stalin asked Zhukov whether Moscow could be successfully defended and ordered him to "speak honestly, like a communist." Zhukov replied that it was possible, but reserves were urgently needed.&lt;ref name="Zhukov28"/&gt; By 27 November, the German 7th Panzer Division had seized a bridgehead across the [[Moscow-Volga Canal]]—the last major obstacle before Moscow—and stood less than {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Kremlin;&lt;ref name="GlantzTTG"/&gt; but a powerful counterattack by the [[1st Shock Army]] drove them back.&lt;ref name="Zhukov30"&gt;Zhukov, tome 2, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Just northwest of Moscow, the Wehrmacht reached [[Lobnya|Krasnaya Polyana]], little more than 29&amp;nbsp;km (18&amp;nbsp;mi) from the Kremlin in central Moscow;&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; German officers were able to make out some of the major buildings of the Soviet capital through their field glasses. Both Soviet and German forces were severely depleted, sometimes having only 150–200 riflemen—a [[Company (military unit)|company]]'s full strength—left in a [[regiment]].&lt;ref name="GlantzTTG"/&gt;

[[File:Soldiers on guard in December 1941 to the west of Moscow.jpg|thumb|German soldiers west of Moscow, December 1941]]

In the south, near Tula, combat resumed on 18 November 1941, with the Second Panzer Army trying to encircle the city.&lt;ref name="GlantzTTG"/&gt; The German forces involved were extremely battered from previous fighting and still had no winter clothing. As a result, initial German progress was only {{convert|5|-|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} per day.&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it exposed the German tank armies to flanking attacks from the Soviet 49th and 50th Armies, located near Tula, further slowing the advance. Guderian nevertheless was able to pursue the offensive, spreading his forces in a star-like attack, taking [[Stalinogorsk]] on 22 November 1941 and surrounding a Soviet rifle division stationed there. On 26 November, German tanks approached [[Kashira]], a city controlling a major highway to Moscow. In response, a Soviet counterattack was launched the following day. General [[Pavel Belov]]'s [[2nd Cavalry Corps (Soviet Union)|2nd Cavalry Corps]], [[1st Guards Cavalry Division]], [[2nd Guards Cavalry Division]] supported by hastily assembled formations, which included 173rd Rifle Division, 9th Tank Brigade, two separate tank battalions, and training and militia units,&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, 'The Road to Stalingrad,' p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; halted the German advance near Kashira.&lt;ref name=GeorgyZhukov/&gt;{{rp|35–36}}&lt;ref&gt;A.P. Belov, ''Moscow is behind us'', Moscow, Voenizdat, 1963, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans were driven back in early December, securing the southern approach to the city.&lt;ref&gt;Belov, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Tula itself held, protected by fortifications and determined defenders mostly from the [[50th army]], made of both soldiers and civilians. In the south, the Wehrmacht never got close to the capital. The first stroke of the Western-Front's counter-offensive on the outskirts of Moscow fell upon Guderian's [[2nd Panzer Army]].&lt;ref&gt;John S Harrel&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the resistance on both the northern and southern sides of Moscow, on 1&amp;nbsp;December the Wehrmacht attempted a direct offensive from the west along the Minsk-Moscow highway near the city of [[Naro-Fominsk]]. This offensive had limited tank support and was directed against extensive Soviet defenses. After meeting determined resistance from the Soviet [[1st Guards Motor Rifle Division|1st Guards Motorized Rifle Division]] and flank counterattacks staged by the [[33rd Army (Soviet Union)|33rd Army]], the German offensive stalled and was driven back four days later in the ensuing Soviet counteroffensive.&lt;ref name="GlantzTTG"/&gt; On the same day, the French-manned [[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism|638th Infantry Regiment]], the only foreign formation of the Wehrmacht that took part in the advance on Moscow, went into action near the village of Diutkovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beyda|first=Oleg|s2cid=148469794|date=7 August 2016|title='La Grande Armée in Field Gray': The Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism, 1941|journal=The Journal of Slavic Military Studies|volume=29|issue=3|pages=500–18|doi=10.1080/13518046.2016.1200393|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2&amp;nbsp;December, a reconnaissance battalion came to the town of [[Khimki#History|Khimki]]—some {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from the Kremlin in central Moscow reaching its bridge over the Moscow-Volga Canal as well as its railway station.

The Axis offensive on Moscow stopped. [[Heinz Guderian]] wrote in his journal that "the offensive on Moscow failed&amp;nbsp;... We underestimated the enemy's strength, as well as his size and climate. Fortunately, I stopped my troops on 5&amp;nbsp;December, otherwise the catastrophe would be unavoidable."&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, pp. 354–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artificial floods===

Some historians have suggested that artificial floods played an important role in defending Moscow.&lt;ref name=KuzeevEcho&gt;Iskander Kuzeev, [http://echo.msk.ru/programs/victory/524051-echo/ "Moscow flood in autumn of 1941"], ''[[Echo of Moscow]]'', 30 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They were primarily meant to break the ice and prevent troops and heavy military equipment from crossing the Volga river and [[Ivankovo Reservoir]].&lt;ref name=ArkhipovLJ&gt;Mikhail Arkhipov, [http://riverpilgrim.livejournal.com/65733.html "Flooding north of Moscow Oblast in 1941"], Private blog, 2&amp;nbsp;October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This began with the blowing up of the {{ill|Istra, Istrinsky District, Moscow Oblast|lt=Istra|ru|Истринское водохранилище|display=1}} waterworks reservoir dam on 24 November 1941. On 28 November 1941, the water was drained into the [[Yakhroma River|Yakhroma]] and [[Sestra River (Moscow Oblast)|Sestra Rivers]] from six reservoirs ({{ill|Khimki|ru|Химкинское водохранилище|display=1}}, {{ill|Iksha|ru|Икшинское водохранилище|display=1}}, {{ill|Pyalovskoye|ru|Пяловское водохранилище}}, {{ill|Pestovskoye reservoir|lt=Pestovskoye|ru|Пестовское водохранилище}}, {{ill|Pirogovskoye|ru|Пироговское водохранилище}}, and {{ill|Klyazma|ru|Клязьминское водохранилище}} reservoirs), as well as from Ivankovo Reservoir using dams near [[Dubna]].&lt;ref name=KuzeevEcho/&gt; This caused some 30–40 villages to become partially submerged even in the severe winter weather conditions of the time.&lt;ref name=KuzeevEcho/&gt;&lt;ref name=MoscowVolga&gt;Igor Kuvyrkov, [http://moskva-volga.ru/moskovskij-potop-1941-goda-novye-dannye/ "Moscow flood in 1941: new data"], ''Moscow Volga channel'', 23 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
Both were results of Soviet General Headquarters' Order 0428 dated 17 November 1941. Artificial floods were also used as unconventional weapon of direct impact.&lt;ref name=CARMD&gt;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Central_Archive_of_the_Soviet_Ministry_of_Defence_-_Stock_208_inventory_2511_case_1039.pdf&amp;page=112 Operational overview of military activities on Western Front in year 1941], ''Central Archive of the Soviet Ministry of Defence'', Stock 208 inventory 2511 case 1039, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet counter-offensive==
[[File:Map Soviet 1941 Winter counteroffensive.jpg|thumb|350px|The Soviet winter counter-offensive, 5&amp;nbsp;December 1941&amp;nbsp;– 7 May 1942]]

Although the Wehrmacht's offensive had been stopped, German intelligence estimated that Soviet forces had no more reserves left and thus would be unable to stage a counteroffensive. This estimate proved wrong, as Stalin transferred over 18 divisions, 1,700 tanks, and over 1,500 aircraft from Siberia and the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Army had accumulated a 58-division reserve by early December,&lt;ref name= "Jukes32"/&gt; when the offensive proposed by Zhukov and Vasilevsky was finally approved by Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;Zhukov, tome 2, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with these new reserves, Soviet forces committed to the operation numbered only 1,100,000 men,&lt;ref name="GlantzDecCounter"/&gt; only slightly outnumbering the ''Wehrmacht''. Nevertheless, with careful troop deployment, a ratio of two-to-one was reached at some critical points.&lt;ref name="Jukes32"/&gt;

On 5&amp;nbsp;December 1941, the counteroffensive for "removing the immediate threat to Moscow" started on the Kalinin Front. The South-Western Front and Western Fronts began their offensives the next day. After several days of little progress, Soviet armies retook Solnechnogorsk on 12 December and Klin on 15 December. Guderian's army "beat a hasty retreat towards Venev" and then Sukhinichi. "The threat overhanging Tula was removed."&lt;ref name=GeorgyZhukov/&gt;{{rp|44–46, 48–51}}

On 8&amp;nbsp;December, Hitler had signed his [[Führer Directives|directive]] No.39, ordering the Wehrmacht to assume a defensive stance on the whole front. German troops were unable to organize a solid defense at their present locations and were forced to pull back to consolidate their lines. Guderian wrote that discussions with [[Hans Schmidt (general of the infantry)|Hans Schmidt]] and [[Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen]] took place the same day, and both commanders agreed the current front line could not be held.&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, pp. 353–55.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 December, [[Franz Halder]] and [[Günther von Kluge]] finally gave permission for a limited withdrawal to the west of the [[Oka river]], without Hitler's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 December, during a meeting with German senior officers, Hitler cancelled the withdrawal and ordered his soldiers to defend every patch of ground, "digging trenches with howitzer shells if needed."&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, pp. 360–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Guderian protested, pointing out that losses from cold were actually greater than combat losses and that winter equipment was held by traffic ties in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, pp. 363–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Hitler insisted on defending the existing lines, and Guderian was dismissed by 25 December, along with generals Hoepner and Strauss, commanders of the 4th Panzer and 9th Army, respectively. [[Fedor von Bock]] was also dismissed, officially for "medical reasons".&lt;ref name="GSEMoscow"&gt;Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Moscow, 1973–78, entry "Battle of Moscow 1941–42"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walther von Brauchitsch]], Hitler's commander-in-chief, had been removed even earlier, on 19 December.&lt;ref name=GeorgyZhukov/&gt;{{rp|42}}&lt;ref name="Guderian 359"&gt;Guderian, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soviet machinegunner opened covering fire.jpg|thumb|left|A Soviet machine gunner covers attacking infantry near Tula, in November 1941.]]
Meanwhile, the Soviet offensive continued in the north. The offensive liberated Kalinin and the Soviets reached Klin on 7&amp;nbsp;December, overrunning the headquarters of the [[LVI Panzer Corps|LVI ''Panzer'' Corps]] outside the city. As the Kalinin Front drove west, a bulge developed around Klin. The Soviet front commander, General [[Ivan Konev]], attempted to envelop any German forces remaining. Zhukov diverted more forces to the southern end of the bulge, to help Konev trap the [[3rd Panzer Army|Third Panzer Army]]. The Germans pulled their forces out in time. Although the encirclement failed, it unhinged the German defenses. A second attempt was made to outflank Army Group Centre's northern forces, but met strong opposition near Rzhev and was forced to halt, forming a salient that would last until March 1943. In the south, the offensive went equally well, with Southwestern Front forces relieving [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] on 16 December 1941. A major achievement was the encirclement and destruction of the [[XXXV Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|German XXXV Corps]], protecting Guderian's Second Panzer Army's southern flank.&lt;ref&gt;Glantz and House 1995, pp. 88–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Luftwaffe'' was paralysed in the second half of December. The weather, recorded as –42&amp;nbsp;°C (–44&amp;nbsp;°F), was a meteorological record.&lt;ref name="Bergstrom 2003, p. 297"&gt;Bergstrom 2003, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Logistical difficulties and freezing temperatures created technical difficulties until January 1942. In the meantime, the ''Luftwaffe'' had virtually vanished from the skies over Moscow, while the [[Red Air Force]], operating from better prepared bases and benefiting from interior lines, grew stronger.&lt;ref name="Bergstrom 2003, p. 297"/&gt; On 4&amp;nbsp;January, the skies cleared. The ''Luftwaffe'' was quickly reinforced, as Hitler hoped it would save the situation. The ''Kampfgruppen'' (Bomber Groups) II./[[KG 4]] and II./[[KG 30]] arrived from refitting in Germany, whilst four ''Transportgruppen'' (Transport Groups) with a strength of 102 [[Junkers Ju 52]] transports were deployed from ''[[Luftflotte 4]]'' (Air Fleet 4) to evacuate surrounded army units and improve the supply line to the front-line forces. It was a last minute effort and it worked. The German air arm was to help prevent a total collapse of Army Group Centre. Despite the Soviets' best efforts, the ''Luftwaffe'' had contributed enormously to the survival of Army Group Centre. Between 17 and 22 December the ''Luftwaffe'' destroyed 299 motor vehicles and 23 tanks around Tula, hampering the Red Army's pursuit of the German Army.&lt;ref&gt;Bergström 2007, pp. 112–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergström 2003, p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the centre, Soviet progress was much slower. Soviet troops liberated Naro-Fominsk only on 26 December, Kaluga on 28 December, and Maloyaroslavets on 2&amp;nbsp;January, after ten days of violent action. Soviet reserves ran low, and the offensive halted on 7&amp;nbsp;January 1942, after having pushed the exhausted and freezing German armies back {{convert|100|-|250|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Moscow. Stalin continued to order more offensives in order to trap and destroy Army Group Centre in front of Moscow, but the Red Army was exhausted and overstretched and they failed.&lt;ref&gt;Glantz and House 1995, pp. 91–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Army's winter counter-offensive drove the Wehrmacht from Moscow, but the city was still considered to be threatened, with the front line relatively close. Because of this, the Moscow theater remained a priority for Stalin, who at first appeared to be in shock due to the initial German success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Planning for war: the Red Army and the catastrophe of 1941|last = Roberts|first = Cynthia A.|date = December 1995|journal = Europe-Asia Studies|doi = 10.1080/09668139508412322|pmid = |access-date = |quote = Marshal Georgii K.

Immediately after the Moscow counter-offensive, a series of Soviet attacks (the [[Battles of Rzhev]]) were attempted against the salient, each time with heavy losses on both sides. By early 1943, the Wehrmacht had to disengage from the salient as the whole front was moving west. Nevertheless, the Moscow front was not finally secured until October 1943, when Army Group Centre was decisively repulsed from the Smolensk landbridge and from the left shore of the upper [[Dnieper]] at the end of the [[Battle of Smolensk (1943)|Second Battle of Smolensk]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

[[File:Moscow Strikes Back 27-40 Germans Surrendering.jpg|thumb|left|German soldiers surrender: still from the documentary ''[[Moscow Strikes Back]]'', 1942]]
Furious that his army had been unable to take Moscow, Hitler dismissed his commander-in-chief, [[Walther von Brauchitsch]], on 19 December 1941, and took personal charge of the Wehrmacht,&lt;ref name="Guderian 359"/&gt; effectively taking control of all military decisions. Additionally, Hitler surrounded himself with staff officers with little or no recent combat experience.&lt;ref&gt;Guderian, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time since June 1941, Soviet forces had stopped the Germans and driven them back. This resulted in Stalin becoming overconfident and deciding to further expand the offensive. On 5&amp;nbsp;January 1942, during a meeting in the Kremlin, Stalin announced that he was planning a general spring offensive, which would be staged simultaneously near Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov, and the Crimea. This plan was accepted over Zhukov's objections.&lt;ref&gt;Zhukov, tome 2, pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Low Red Army reserves and Wehrmacht tactical skill led to a bloody stalemate near Rzhev, known as the "[[Battles of Rzhev|Rzhev meat grinder]]", and to a string of Red Army defeats, such as the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]], the failed attempt at elimination of the [[Demyansk pocket]], and the encirclement of General [[Andrey Vlasov]]'s army in a [[Lyuban Offensive Operation|failed attempt]] to lift the [[siege of Leningrad]], and the [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula|destruction]] of Red Army forces in Crimea. Ultimately, these failures would lead to a successful German offensive in the south and to the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

A documentary film, ''[[Moscow Strikes Back]]'', ({{lang-ru|Разгром немецких войск под Москвой}}, "Rout of the German Troops near Moscow"), was made during the battle and rapidly released in the Soviet Union. It was taken to America and shown at the Globe in New York in August 1942. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reviewer commented that "The savagery of that retreat is a spectacle to stun the mind."&lt;ref name=NYT1942/&gt; As well as the Moscow parade and battle scenes, the film included images of German atrocities committed during the occupation, "the naked and slaughtered children stretched out in ghastly rows, the youths dangling limply in the cold from gallows that were rickety, but strong enough."&lt;ref name=NYT1942&gt;{{cite web|last1=T.S. |title=Movie Review: Moscow Strikes Back (1942) 'Moscow Strikes Back,' Front-Line Camera Men's Story of Russian Attack, Is Seen at the Globe |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501E0D7113CE33BBC4F52DFBE668389659EDE |work=The New York Times |accessdate=18 March 2015 |date=17 August 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Souvenir sheet of Russia stamp no. 716 - 60th anniversary of the Battle of Moscow.jpg|thumb|2001 Russian stamp for the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Moscow]]
The defense of Moscow became a symbol of Soviet resistance against the invading Axis forces. To commemorate the battle, Moscow was awarded the title of "[[Hero City]]" in 1965, on the 20th anniversary of [[Victory Day]]. A Museum of the Defence of Moscow was created in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Rodric Braithwaite, "Moscow 1941: A City and Its People at War", p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Russia]]n capital of [[Moscow]], an annual military parade on [[Red Square]] on 7&amp;nbsp;November in honor of the [[1941 October Revolution Parade|October Revolution Parade]] and as substitute for the October Revolution celebrations that haven't been celebrated on a national level since 1995. The parade is held to commemorate the historical event as a [[Days of Military Honour|Day of Military Honour]]. The parade includes troops of the [[Moscow Garrison]] and the [[Western Military District]], which usually numbers to close to 3,000 soldiers, cadets, and [[Red Army]] reenactors. The parade is presided by the [[Mayor of Moscow]] who delivers a speech during the event. Prior to the start of the parade, an historical reenactment of the Battle of Moscow is performed by young students, volunteers, and historical enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;For example {{cite news |title=Russia re-enacts historic WW2 parade in Moscow |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-50330568/russia-re-enacts-historic-ww2-parade-in-moscow |work=BBC News |date=7 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:4Samarin.jpg|thumb|Soldiers dressed in [[Red Army]] uniforms carrying the standards of the military fronts of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] on [[Red Square]], 7 November 2018.]]

The parade commands are always given by a high ranking veteran of the armed forces (usually with a billet of a Colonel) who gives the orders for the march past from the grandstand near the [[Lenin Mausoleum]]. On the command of ''Quick March!'' by the parade commander, the parade begins with the tune of ''[[Song of the Soviet Army]]'', to which the historical [[color guard]]s holding wartime symbols such as the [[Banner of Victory]] and the standards of the various military fronts march to. Musical support during the parade is always provided by the Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison, which includes various military bands in the Western Military District, The [[Band of the 154th Preobrazhensky Regiment|Regimental Band of the 154th Preobrazhensky Regiment]], and the [[Central Military Band of the Ministry of Defense of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://anydayguide.com/calendar/349|title=Anniversary of the 1941 October Revolution Day Parade in Russia / November 7, 2016|last=AnydayGuide|newspaper=AnydayGuide|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/2018/11/08/russia-marks-anniversary-military-parade/ | title=Russia marks anniversary of 1941 military parade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==
Both German and Soviet casualties during the battle of Moscow have been a subject of debate, as various sources provide somewhat different estimates. Not all historians agree on what should be considered the "Battle of Moscow" in the timeline of World War II. While the start of the battle is usually regarded as the beginning of Operation Typhoon on 30 September 1941 (or sometimes on 2&amp;nbsp;October 1941), there are two different dates for the end of the offensive.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} In particular, some sources (such as Erickson&lt;ref name="Erickson"&gt;John Erickson, ''Barbarossa: The Axis and the Allies'', table 12.4&lt;/ref&gt; and Glantz&lt;ref name="GlantzB"&gt;Glantz, Table B&lt;/ref&gt;) exclude the Rzhev offensive from the scope of the battle, considering it as a distinct operation and making the Moscow offensive "stop" on 7&amp;nbsp;January 1942—thus lowering the number of casualties.{{original research inline|date=January 2020}}

There are also significant differences in figures from various sources. John Erickson, in his ''Barbarossa: The Axis and the Allies'', gives a figure of 653,924 Soviet casualties between October 1941 and January 1942.&lt;ref name="Erickson"/&gt; Glantz, in his book ''When Titans Clashed'', gives a figure of 658,279 for the defense phase alone, plus 370,955 for the winter counteroffensive until 7&amp;nbsp;January 1942.&lt;ref name="GlantzB"/&gt; The official Wehrmacht daily casualty reports show 35,757 killed in action, 128,716 wounded, and 9,721 missing in action for the entire Army Group Centre between 1&amp;nbsp;October 1941 and 10 January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heeresarzt 10-Day Casualty Reports per Army/Army Group, 1941|url=http://ww2stats.com/cas_ger_okh_dec41.html|accessdate=28 March 2012|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025022023/http://ww2stats.com/cas_ger_okh_dec41.html|archivedate=25 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this official report does not match unofficial reports from individual battalion and divisional officers and commanders at the front, who record suffering far higher casualties than was officially reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Retreat|last = Jones|first = Michael|publisher = Thomas Dunne Books|year = 2009|isbn = 978-0719569265|location = New York|pages = 107, 126–27, 292}}&lt;/ref&gt;
