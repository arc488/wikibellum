The '''Volturno Line''' (also known as the '''Viktor Line'''; {{Lang-de|Volturno-Linie, Viktor-Linie}}, {{Lang-it|Linea del Volturno}}) was a [[Wehrmacht|German]] defensive position in [[Italy]] during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War II]].

The line ran from [[Termoli]] in the east, along the [[Biferno River]] through the [[Apennine Mountains]] to the [[Volturno|Volturno River]] in the west.

Following the [[Allied invasion of Italy]] in September 1943 the German forces set up a series of defensive lines across Italy, intended to delay the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] advance. The '''Volturno Line''' was the southernmost of these.

{{main|Operation Devon}}
As a response to the increasing Allied pressure on the Adriatic front, on October 1st the German supreme commander in Italy—[[Generalfeldmarschall|''Generalfeldmarshall'']] [[Albert Kesselring]]—ordered the [[16th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|16th Panzer Division]] to switch to the Adriatic front. Elements of the [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 78th Infantry Division]]'s [[11th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters South East|11th Brigade]] infantry crossed the Biferno at dawn on 3 October 1943 following an amphibious landing at Termoli by [[British Commandos]] at 02:15.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, p116&lt;/ref&gt; By late morning, the two elements had linked up and that night 78th Division's [[36th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|36th Brigade]] were able to be landed by sea at [[Termoli]]. However, logistical problems had prevented the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] building a heavy duty bridge across the Biferno and when the bulldozed fords were made unusable after 5 tanks had crossed, there was no way to get more tanks across the river to support the infantry. A lighter weight FBE bridge was built to allow artillery, recconnaissance, and other vehicles to cross. The move east of [[16th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|16th Panzer Division]] presented a major and unforeseen threat to the unsupported Allied infantry. As news of the German armour's arrival came in on 4 October, 78th Division's commander— [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Vyvyan Evelegh]]—demanded priority from [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], under [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]], for bridging equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, p130&lt;/ref&gt; As more German armour arrived, the Allied troops across the Biferno were forced onto the defensive. By the afternoon of 5 October, they had been squeezed back to within {{convert|.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} of Termoli.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, p 136&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the same time frantic round the clock efforts by engineers had resulted in a heavyweight [[Bailey bridge]] being completed allowing Canadian and British armour across the Biferno. That evening, 78th Division's [[38th (Irish) Brigade]] arrived by sea at Termoli and the German attack the following morning was narrowly repulsed in desperate fighting. By late morning on 6 October, the Allies were on the attack and by late afternoon the Germans had started to fall back to the next prepared defences on the [[Trigno|River Trigno]], the [[Barbara Line]].&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 9137-141&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other coast, the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]], commanded by [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Mark W. Clark]], attacked across the Volturno on the night of 12 October.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Clark, p37&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans using rearguard tactics skillfully using the terrain which was favourable for defence, retreated to the next line north (the [[Barbara Line]]) which the Allies reached by 2 November.
