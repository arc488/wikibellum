The '''Second Battle of El Alamein''' (23 October – 11 November 1942) was a battle of the [[Second World War]] that took place near the [[Egypt]]ian [[Railway station|railway halt]] of [[El Alamein]]. The [[First Battle of El Alamein]] and the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa]] had prevented the [[Axis powers|Axis]] from advancing further into Egypt.

In August 1942, [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck]] had been relieved as Commander-in-Chief [[Middle East Command]] and his successor, Lieutenant-General [[William Gott]] was killed on his way to replace him as commander of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]. [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] was appointed and led the Eighth Army offensive.

The Allied victory was the beginning of the end of the [[Western Desert Campaign]], eliminating the Axis threat to [[Egypt]], the [[Suez Canal]] and the Middle Eastern and Persian oil fields. The battle revived the morale of the Allies, being the first big success against the Axis since [[Operation Crusader]] in late 1941. The battle coincided with the Allied invasion of [[French North Africa]] in [[Operation Torch]] on 8 November, the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]].

{{Further|Second Battle of El Alamein order of battle}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-443-1589-07, Nordafrika, Rommel in Befehlsfahrzeug.jpg|thumb|[[Erwin Rommel]] (left) in his [[Sd.Kfz. 250|Sd.Kfz. 250/3]] command halftrack.]]
[[Panzer Army Africa]] ({{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}}/{{lang|it|Armata Corazzata Africa}}, ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]]), composed of German and Italian tank and infantry units, had advanced into [[Egypt]] after its success at the [[Battle of Gazala]] (26 May – 21 June 1942). The Axis advance threatened British control of the [[Suez Canal]], the Middle East and its oil resources. [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck]] withdrew the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]] to within {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[Alexandria]] where the [[Qattara Depression]] was {{convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[El Alamein]] on the coast. The depression was impassable and meant that any attack had to be frontal; Axis attacks in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]] (1–27 July) were defeated.

Eighth Army counter-attacks in July also failed, as the Axis forces dug in and regrouped. Auchinleck called off the attacks at the end of July to rebuild the army. In early August, the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]] and General Sir [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Alan Brooke]], the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), visited [[Cairo]] and replaced Auchinleck as [[Commander-in-chief]] [[Middle East Command]] with General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]]. [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[William Gott]] was made commander of the Eighth Army but was killed when his transport aircraft was shot down by ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' fighters; Lieutenant-General [[Bernard Montgomery]] was flown from Britain to replace him.

Lacking reinforcements and depending on small, underdeveloped ports for supplies, aware of a huge [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] reinforcement operation for the Eighth Army, Rommel decided to attack first. The two armoured divisions of the ''[[Afrika Korps]]'' and the reconnaissance units of {{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}} led the attack but were repulsed at the Alam el Halfa ridge and Point 102 on 30 August 1942 during the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa]] and the Axis forces retired to their start lines. The short front line and secure flanks favoured the [[Axis powers|Axis]] defence and Rommel had time to develop the Axis defences, sowing extensive [[minefield]]s with {{circa|500,000}} mines and miles of [[barbed wire]].{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2003|p=255}} Alexander and Montgomery intended to establish a superiority of force sufficient to achieve a [[Breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] and exploit it to destroy {{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}}. Earlier in the [[Western Desert Campaign]], neither side had been able to exploit a local victory sufficiently to defeat its opponent before it had withdrawn and transferred the problem of over-extended supply lines to the victor.

The British had an intelligence advantage because [[Ultra]] and local sources exposed the Axis order of battle, its supply position and intentions. A reorganisation of military intelligence in Africa in July had also improved the integration of information received from all sources and the speed of its dissemination.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=425}} With rare exceptions, intelligence identified the supply ships destined for North Africa, their location or routing and in most cases their cargoes, allowing them to be attacked.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=423}} By 25 October, {{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}} was down to three days' supply of fuel, only two days' worth of which were east of Tobruk. [[Harry Hinsley]], the official historian of British intelligence wrote in 1981 that "The Panzer Army...&amp;nbsp;did not possess the operational freedom of movement that was absolutely essential in consideration of the fact that the British offensive can be expected to start any day".{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=427}} Submarine and air transport somewhat eased the shortage of ammunition and by late October, there was sixteen days' supply at the front.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=427}} After six more weeks, the Eighth Army was ready; {{nowrap|195,000 men}} and {{nowrap|1,029 tanks}} began the offensive against the {{nowrap|116,000 men}} and {{nowrap|547 tanks}} of the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}}.

==Prelude==

===Allied plan===

====Operation Lightfoot====
Montgomery's plan was for a main attack to the north of the line and a secondary attack to the south, involving [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Oliver Leese]]) and [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Brian Horrocks]]), while [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|X Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Herbert Lumsden]]) was to exploit the success.{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|1994|p=219}} With Operation Lightfoot, Montgomery intended to cut two corridors through the Axis minefields in the north. One corridor was to run south-west through the [[2nd New Zealand Division]] sector towards the centre of Miteirya Ridge, while the second was to run west, passing {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of the west end of the Miteirya Ridge across the [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Australian]] and [[51st (Highland) Division]] sectors.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=34}} Tanks would then pass through and defeat the German armour. Diversions at Ruweisat Ridge in the centre and also the south of the line would keep the rest of the Axis forces from moving northwards. Montgomery expected a 12-day battle in three stages: the break-in, the dogfight and the final breaking of the enemy.{{sfn|Dear|2005|p=254}}

For the first night of the offensive, Montgomery planned for four infantry divisions of XXX Corps to advance on a {{convert|26|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} front to the Oxalic Line, over-running the forward Axis defences. Engineers would clear and mark the two lanes through the minefields, through which the armoured divisions from X Corps would pass to gain the Pierson Line. They would rally and consolidate their position just west of the infantry positions, blocking an Axis tank counter-attack. The British tanks would then advance to ''Skinflint'', astride the north–south Rahman Track deep in the Axis defensive system, to challenge the Axis armour.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=34}} The infantry battle would continue as the Eighth Army infantry "crumbled" the deep Axis defensive fortifications (three successive lines of fortification had been constructed) and destroy any tanks that attacked them.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|pp=430–431}}{{efn|The [[Polish Mine Detector]] designed in Scotland in 1941 by the Polish engineer and signals officer, Lieutnant [[Józef Kosacki]] was to be used for the first time in action. Five hundred of these were issued to Eighth Army. The apparatus doubled the speed at which heavily mined sands could be cleared, from around {{convert|100|m|yd}} to about {{convert|200|m|yd|abbr=on}} an hour.{{sfn|Modelski|1986|p=221}}}}

====Operation Bertram====

{{main|Operation Bertram}}

The [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces practised a number of deceptions in the months before the battle to confuse the Axis command as to the whereabouts of the forthcoming battle and when the battle was likely to occur. This operation was code-named [[Operation Bertram]]. In September, they dumped waste materials (discarded packing cases, etc.) under camouflage nets in the northern sector, making them appear to be ammunition or ration dumps. The Axis naturally noticed these but, as no offensive action immediately followed and the "dumps" did not change in appearance, they were subsequently ignored. This allowed Eighth Army to build up supplies in the forward area unnoticed by the Axis, by replacing the rubbish with ammunition, petrol or rations at night. Meanwhile, a dummy pipeline was built, hopefully leading the Axis to believe the attack would occur much later than it, in fact, did and much further south. To further the illusion, dummy tanks consisting of plywood frames placed over jeeps were constructed and deployed in the south. In a reverse [[feint]], the tanks destined for battle in the north were disguised as supply trucks by placing removable plywood superstructures over them.{{sfn|Lucas|1983|p=123}}

====Operation Braganza====

{{main|Operation Braganza}}

As a preliminary, the [[131st Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|131st (Queen's) Infantry Brigade]] of the [[44th (Home Counties) Division|44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division]], supported by tanks from the [[4th Infantry Brigade and Headquarters North East|4th Armoured Brigade]], launched [[Operation Braganza]] attacking the [[185th Airborne Division Folgore]] on the night of 29/30 September in an attempt to capture the Deir el Munassib area. The Italian [[paratrooper]]s repelled the attack, killing or capturing over 300 of the attackers.{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=269}} It was wrongly assumed that ''[[Fallschirmjäger (World War II)|Fallschirmjäger]]'' (German paratroopers) had manned the defences and been responsible for the British reverse. The ''Afrika Korps'' war diary notes that the Italian paratroops "bore the brunt of the attack. It fought well and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;Afrika Korps War Diary, 30 September 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

===Axis plan===
[[File:2 Battle of El Alamein 001.png|thumb|Deployment of forces on the eve of battle.]]
With the failure of the offensive at the Battle of Alam el Halfa, the Axis forces went onto the defensive but losses had not been excessive. The Axis supply line from [[Tripoli]] was extremely long and captured Allied supplies and equipment had been exhausted, but Rommel decided to advance into Egypt.{{sfn|Creveld|1997|p=196}}{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=111-116}}

The Eighth Army was being supplied with men and materials from the United Kingdom, India, Australia and New Zealand, as well as with trucks and the new [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]] from the United States. Rommel continued to request equipment, supplies and fuel but the priority of the German war effort was the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and very limited supplies reached North Africa&lt;!--really?--&gt;. Rommel was ill and in early September, arrangements were made for him to return to Germany on sick leave and for ''[[General der Panzertruppe]]'' [[Georg Stumme]] to transfer from the Russian front to take his place. Before he left for Germany on 23 September, Rommel organised the defence and wrote a long appreciation of the situation to ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (OKW armed forces high command), once again setting out the essential needs of the Panzer Army.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=26}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1980-009-34, Georg Stumme.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|left|[[Georg Stumme]] in 1940.]]
Rommel knew that the British Commonwealth forces would soon be strong enough to attack. His only hope now relied on the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German forces]] fighting in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] quickly to defeat the [[Red Army]], then move south through the [[Caucasus|Trans-Caucasus]] and threaten Iran (Persia) and the Middle East. If successful, large numbers of British and Commonwealth forces would have to be sent from the Egyptian front to reinforce the Ninth Army in Iran, leading to the postponement of any offensive against his army. Rommel hoped to convince OKW to reinforce his forces for the eventual link-up between {{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}} and the German armies fighting in southern Russia, enabling them finally to defeat the British and Commonwealth armies in North Africa and the Middle East.

In the meantime, the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} dug in and waited for the attack by the Eighth Army or the defeat of the Red Army at Stalingrad. Rommel added depth to his defences by creating at least two belts of mines about {{convert|5|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} apart, connected at intervals to create boxes ([[Devil's gardens]]) which would restrict enemy penetration and deprive British armour of room for manoeuvre. The front face of each box was lightly held by battle outposts and the rest of the box was unoccupied but sowed with mines and explosive traps and covered by enfilading fire.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|pp=432–433}} The main defensive positions were built to a depth of at least {{convert|2|km|mi}} behind the second mine belt.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=27–28}} The Axis laid around half a million mines, mostly [[Teller mine|Teller anti-tank mines]] with some smaller anti-personnel types (such as the [[S-mine]]). (Many of these mines were British, and had been captured at Tobruk). To lure enemy vehicles into the minefields, the Italians dragged an axle and tyres through the fields using a long rope to create what appeared to be well-used tracks.{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2003|p=255}}

[[File:Ettore Bastico.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|Marshal Ettore Bastico|alt=]]
Rommel did not want the British armour to break out into the open because he had neither the strength of numbers nor fuel to match them in a battle of manoeuvre. The battle had to be fought in the fortified zones; a breakthrough had to be defeated quickly. Rommel stiffened his forward lines by alternating German and Italian infantry formations. Because the Allied deception confused the Axis as to the point of attack, Rommel departed from his usual practice of holding his armoured strength in a concentrated reserve and split it into a northern group ([[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer]] and [[133rd Armoured Division Littorio|''Littorio'' Division]]) and a southern group ([[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer]] and [[132nd Armoured Division Ariete|''Ariete'' Division]]), each organised into [[Battlegroup (army)|battle groups]] to be able to make a quick armoured intervention wherever the blow fell and prevent narrow breakthroughs from being enlarged. A significant proportion of his armoured reserve was dispersed and held unusually far forward. The 15th Panzer Division had 125 operational tanks (16 Pz.IIs, 43 Pz.III Ausf H, 43 Pz.III Ausf J, 6 Pz.IV Ausf D, 15 Pz.IV Ausf F) while the 21st Panzer Division had 121 operational combat vehicles (12 Pz.IIs, 38 Pz.III Ausf H, 43 Pz.III Ausf J, 2 Pz.IV Ausf D, 15 Pz.IV Ausf F).{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=8}}

Rommel held the [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Light Division]] further back and kept the [[101st Motorised Division Trieste|''Trieste'' Motorised Division]] in reserve near the coast.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=28–29}} Rommel hoped to move his troops faster than the Allies, to concentrate his defences at the most important point ({{lang|de|Schwerpunkt}}) but lack of fuel meant that once the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} had concentrated, it would not be able to move again because of lack of fuel.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=20}} The British were well aware that Rommel would be unable to mount a defence based on his usual manoeuvre tactics but no clear picture emerged of how he would fight the battle and British plans seriously underestimated the Axis defences and the fighting power of the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}}&lt;!--really?--&gt;.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=431}}

==Battle==

===Phase one: the break-in===
[[File:The Campaign in North Africa 1940-1943 E18469.jpg|thumb|left|British night artillery barrage which opened the second Battle of El Alamein]]
Prior to the main barrage, there was a diversion by the [[24th Brigade (Australia)|24th Australian Brigade]], which involved the 15th Panzer Division being subjected to heavy fire for a few minutes.{{sfn|Latimer|2002|p=177}} Then at 21:40 (Egyptian Summer Time) on 23 October{{sfn|Mead|2007|p=304}} on a calm, clear evening under the bright sky of a full moon, Operation Lightfoot began with a 1,000-gun barrage.  The fire plan had been arranged so that the first rounds from the 882 guns from the field and medium batteries would land along the {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} front at the same time.{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=308}} After twenty minutes of general bombardment, the guns switched to precision targets in support of the advancing infantry.{{sfn|Clifford|1943|p=307}} The shelling plan continued for five and a half hours, by the end of which each gun had fired about 600 rounds, about 529,000 shells.

Operation Lightfoot alluded to the infantry attacking first. Anti-tank mines would not be tripped by soldiers stepping on them since they were too light. As the infantry advanced, engineers had to clear a path for the tanks coming behind. Each gap was to be {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, which was just enough to get tanks through in single file. The engineers had to clear a {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} route through the Devil's Gardens. It was a difficult task that was not achieved because of the depth of the Axis minefields.

[[File:250 Squadron RAF Kittyhawk Egypt 1942 IWM CM 3756.jpg|thumb|upright|Kittyhawk Mark III, of No. 250 Squadron RAF taxiing at LG 91, Egypt, during Operation Lightfoot]]
At 22:00, the four infantry divisions of XXX Corps began to move. The objective was to establish a bridgehead before dawn at the imaginary line in the desert where the strongest enemy defences were situated, on the far side of the second mine belt. Once the infantry reached the first minefields, the mine sweepers, including Reconnaissance Corps troops and [[sapper]]s, moved in to create a passage for the armoured divisions of X Corps. Progress was slower than planned but at 02:00, the first of the 500 tanks crawled forward. By 04:00, the lead tanks were in the minefields, where they stirred up so much dust that there was no visibility at all, traffic jams developed and tanks bogged down. Only about half of the infantry attained their objectives and none of the tanks broke through.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=438}}

[[File:Paracadutista El Alamein14.jpg|thumb|upright|Original military uniform of an Italian paratrooper of the division Folgore in 1942]]
The [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]] (with one Free French Brigade under command) from XIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks) made a secondary attack to the south. The main attack aimed to achieve a breakthrough, engage and pin down the [[German 21st Panzer Division|21st Panzer Division]] and the [[Italian Ariete Armoured Division|''Ariete'' Armoured Division]] around Jebel Kalakh, while the Free French on the far left were to secure Qaret el Himeimat and the el Taqa plateau.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=34}} The right flank of the attack was to be protected by 44th Infantry Division with the 131st Infantry Brigade. The attack met determined resistance, mainly from the [[185 Airborne Division Folgore|185 Airborne Division ''Folgore'']], part of the [[Hermann-Bernhard Ramcke|Ramcke]] Parachute Brigade and the Keil Group.{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2003|loc=chapters 22–24}}{{sfn|Bauer|2000|pp=366–368}} The minefields were deeper than anticipated and clearing paths through them was impeded by Axis defensive fire. By dawn on 24 October, paths still had not been cleared through the second minefield to release 22nd and 4th Light Armoured Brigades into the open to make their planned turn north into the rear of enemy positions {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Deir el Munassib.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=34}}

Further north along the XIII Corps front, the 50th Infantry Division achieved a limited and costly success against determined resistance from the [[17 Motorised Division Pavia|''Pavia'' Division]], [[27 Motorised Division Brescia|''Brescia'' Division]] and elements of the 185th Airborne Division ''Folgore''.{{sfn|Bauer|2000|p=368}} The [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Infantry Division]], on the far left of the XXX Corps front at Ruweisat Ridge, made a mock attack and two small raids intended to deflect attention to the centre of the front.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=42}}

===Phase two: the crumbling===
[[File:A mine explodes close to a British truck as it carries infantry through enemy minefields and wire to the new front lines.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A mine explodes close to a British artillery tractor as it advances through enemy minefields and wire to the new front line]]
Dawn aerial reconnaissance showed little change in Axis disposition, so Montgomery gave his orders for the day: the clearance of the northern corridor should be completed and the New Zealand Division supported by 10th Armoured should push south from Miteirya Ridge. 9th Australian Division, in the north, should plan a crumbling operation for that night, while in the southern sector, 7th Armoured should continue to try to break through the minefields with support, if necessary, from 44th Division.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=44}} ''[[Panzer]]'' units counter-attacked the [[British 51st (Highland) Infantry Division (World War II)|51st Highland Division]] just after sunrise, only to be stopped in their tracks.

[[File:El Alamein 1942 - British tanks.jpg|thumb|right|British tanks advance to engage German armour after infantry had opened gaps in the Axis minefield at El Alamein, 24 October 1942]]
The morning of Saturday 24 October brought disaster for the German headquarters.The Axis forces were stunned by Allied attack and their messages became confused and hysterical, with one Italian unit communicating to Germans that it had been wiped out by "drunken negroes with tanks"&lt;ref&gt;The Phantom Army of Alamein: The Men Who Hoodwinked Rommel
Rick Stroud page 211-212&lt;/ref&gt; The reports that Stumme had received that morning showed the attacks had been on a broad front but that such penetration as had occurred should be containable by local units. He went forward himself to observe the state of affairs and, finding himself under fire, suffered a heart attack and died. Temporary command was given to Major-General [[Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma]]. Hitler had already decided that Rommel should leave his sanatorium and return to North Africa. Rommel flew to Rome early on 25 October to press the ''Commando Supremo'' for more fuel and ammunition and then on to North Africa to resume command that night of the Panzer Army Africa, which that day was renamed the German-Italian Panzer Army (''Deutsch-Italienische Panzerarmee'').{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=50}}

There was little activity during the day pending more complete clearance of paths through the minefields. The armour was held at ''Oxalic''.{{sfn|Dear|2005|p=254}} Artillery and the Allied [[Desert Air Force]], making over 1,000 sorties,{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=44}} attacked Axis positions all day to aid the 'crumbling' of the Axis forces. By 16:00 there was little progress.

At dusk, with the sun at their backs, Axis tanks from the [[33rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] and Italian [[133 Armoured Division Littorio|''Littorio'' Division]] swung out from the Kidney feature (also known to the Germans and Italians as Hill 28), often wrongly called a ridge as it was actually a depression, to engage the [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Division]] and the first major tank battle of El Alamein began. Over 100 tanks were involved and half were destroyed by dark. Neither position was altered.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}[[File:Italian reinforcements in final battle El Alamain.jpg|thumb|Italian reinforcements in final battle El Alamain]]

At around 10:00, Axis aircraft had destroyed a convoy of 25 Allied vehicles carrying petrol and ammunition, setting off a night-long blaze; Lumsden wanted to call off the attack, but Montgomery made it clear that his plans were to be carried out.{{sfn|Young|1966|p=260}} The thrust that night by 10th Armoured Division from Miteirya Ridge failed. The lifting of mines on the Miteirya Ridge and beyond took far longer than planned and the leading unit, 8th Armoured Brigade, was caught on their start line at 22:00—zero hour—by an air attack and were scattered. By the time they had reorganised they were well behind schedule and out of touch with the creeping artillery barrage. By daylight the brigade was out in the open taking considerable fire from well sited tanks and anti-tank guns.  Meanwhile [[24th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Armoured Brigade]] had pushed forward and reported at dawn they were on the Pierson line, although it turned out that, in the dust and confusion, they had mistaken their position and were well short.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=46}}

The attack in the XIII Corps sector to the south fared no better. 44th Division's 131st Infantry Brigade cleared a path through the mines, but when 22nd Armoured Brigade passed through, they came under heavy fire and were repulsed, with 31 tanks disabled. Allied air activity that night focused on Rommel's northern armoured group, where {{convert|135|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs were dropped. To prevent a recurrence of 8th Armoured Brigade's experience from the air, attacks on Axis landing fields were also stepped up.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=46}}

====D + 2: 25 October====
The initial thrust had ended by Sunday. The Allies had advanced through the minefields in the west to make a {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} deep inroad. They now sat atop Miteirya Ridge in the south-east. Axis forces were firmly entrenched in most of their original battle positions and the battle was at a standstill. Montgomery decided that the planned advance southward from Miteirya Ridge by the New Zealanders would be too costly and instead decided that XXX Corps—while keeping firm hold of Miteirya—should strike northward toward the coast with 9th Australian Division. Meanwhile, 1st Armoured Division—on the Australians' left—should continue to attack west and north-west, and activity to the south on both Corps fronts would be confined to patrolling.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=47}} The battle would be concentrated at the Kidney feature and Tel el Eisa until a breakthrough occurred.

[[File:RAF Baltimore bombing El Daba airfield.jpg|thumb|right|RAF [[Martin Baltimore|Baltimore]] of No. 223 Squadron bombing El Daba airfield in support of the Alamein offensive]]
By early morning, the Axis forces launched a series of attacks using 15th Panzer and ''Littorio'' divisions. The Panzer Army was probing for a weakness, but without success. When the sun set the Allied infantry went on the attack. Around midnight, 51st Division launched three attacks, but no one knew exactly where they were. Pandemonium and carnage ensued, resulting in the loss of over 500 Allied troops, and leaving only one officer among the attacking forces. While the 51st Highland Division was operating around Kidney Ridge, the Australians were attacking [[Point 29]] (sometimes shown on Axis maps as "28") a {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} high Axis artillery observation post south-west of Tel el Eisa, to surround the Axis coastal salient containing the German 164th Light Division and large numbers of Italian infantry.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=48}}{{sfn|Clifford|1943|p=308}}

This was the new northern thrust Montgomery had devised earlier in the day, and was to be the scene of heated battle for some days. The Australian 26th Brigade attacked at midnight, supported by artillery and 30 tanks of 40th Royal Tank Regiment.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=49}} They took the position and 240 prisoners. Fighting continued in this area for the next week, as the Axis tried to recover the small hill that was so important to their defence. Night bombers dropped {{convert|115|LT|t|abbr=on}} of bombs on targets in the battlefield and {{convert|14|LT|t|abbr=on}} on the ''[[Stuka]]'' base at Sidi Haneish, while night fighters flew patrols over the battle area and the Axis forward landing grounds.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=49}} In the south, the 4th Armoured Brigade and 69th Infantry Brigade attacked the [[187th Paratroopers Regiment "Folgore"|187th Paratroopers Infantry Regiment "Folgore"]] at Deir Munassib, but lost about 20 tanks gaining only the forward positions.{{sfn|Greene|Massignani|1994|p=177}}{{sfn|Montanari|1993|pp=753–754}}

===Phase three: the counter===

====D + 3: 26 October====

Rommel, on his return to North Africa on the evening of 25 October, assessed the battle. Casualties, particularly in the north, as a result of incessant artillery and air attack, had been severe. The Italian [[102 Motorised Division Trento|''Trento'' Division]] had lost 50 per cent of its infantry and most of its artillery, the 164th Light Division had lost two battalions. The 15th Panzer and ''Littorio'' divisions had prevented the Allied tanks from breaking through but this had been a costly defensive success, the 15th Panzer Division being reduced to 31 tanks.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=50}}{{sfn|Young|1966|p=261}} Most other units were also under strength, on half rations and many men were ill; {{lang|de|Panzerarmee Afrika}} had only enough fuel for three days.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=427}}

Rommel was convinced by this time that the main assault would come in the north and determined to retake Point 29.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=23}} He ordered a counter-attack against it by the 15th Panzer Division and the 164th Light Division, with part of the Italian XX Corps to begin at 15:00 but under constant artillery and air attack this came to nothing.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=50–51}} According to Rommel this attack did meet some success, with the Italians recapturing part of ''Hill 28'',

{{quote|Attacks were now launched on Hill 28 by elements of the 15th Panzer Division, the Littorio and a Bersaglieri Battalion, supported by the concentrated fire of all the local artillery and AA. In the evening part of the Bersaglieri Battalion succeeded in occupying the eastern and western edges of the hill.{{sfn|Strawson|1981|p=119}}}}

The bulk of the 2/17th Australian Battalion, which had defended the position, was forced to retreat.{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=360}} Rommel reversed his policy of distributing his armour across the front, ordering the 90th Light Division forward from Ed Daba and 21st Panzer Division north along with one third of the ''Ariete'' Division and half the artillery from the southern sector to join the 15th Panzer Division and the ''Littorio'' Division. The move could not be reversed because of the fuel shortage.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=439}} The ''Trieste'' Division was ordered from Fuka to replace the 90th Light Division at Ed Daba but the 21st Panzer Division and the ''Ariete'' Division made slow progress during the night under constant attack from DAF bombers.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=51}}

At the Kidney feature, the British failed to take advantage of the absent tanks; each time they tried to move forward they were stopped by anti-tank guns. Churchill railed, "Is it really impossible to find a general who can win a battle?"{{sfn|Vivian|2000|p=278}} Three Vickers Wellington torpedo bombers of 38 Squadron destroyed the oil tanker ''Tergestea'' at Tobruk during the night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warfaremagazine.co.uk/articles/untold-stories-from-the-desert-air-force-eighth-armys-enforcer-in-the-second-world-war/144 Untold stories from the Desert Air Force – Eighth Army's enforcer in the Second World War]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bristol Beaufort]] torpedo bombers of [[No. 42 Squadron RAF|42 Squadron]], attached to [[No. 47 Squadron RAF|47 Squadron]], sank the tanker ''Proserpina'' at [[Tobruk]], removing the last hope for refuelling the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}}.

By 26 October, XXX Corps had completed the capture of the bridgehead west of the second mine belt, the tanks of X Corps, established just beyond the infantry, had failed to break through the Axis anti-tank defences.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=438}} Montgomery decided that over the next two days, while continuing the process of attrition, he would thin out his front line to create a reserve for another attack. The reserve was to include the 2nd New Zealand Division (with the 9th Armoured Brigade under command), the 10th Armoured Division and the 7th Armoured Division.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=52}}
The attacks in the south, which lasted three days and caused considerable losses without achieving a breakthrough, were suspended.

====D + 4: 27 October====
{{main|Outpost Snipe}}
[[File:The British Army in North Africa 1942 E18531.jpg|thumb|Tanks of 8th Armoured Brigade waiting just behind the forward positions near El Alamein before being called to join the battle, 27 October 1942]]
By this time, the main battle was concentrated around Tel el Aqqaqir and the Kidney feature at the end of 1st Armoured Division's path through the minefield. A mile north-west of the feature was Outpost Woodcock and roughly the same distance south-west lay Outpost Snipe. An attack was planned on these areas using two battalions from 7th Motor Brigade. At 23:00 on 26 October 2 Battalion, [[The Rifle Brigade]] would attack Snipe and 2nd Battalion [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] (KRRC) would attack Woodcock. The plan was for 2nd Armoured Brigade to pass round the north of Woodcock the following dawn and 24th Armoured Brigade round the south of Snipe. The attack was to be supported by all the available artillery of both X and XXX Corps.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=53–54}}

Both battalions had difficulty finding their way in the dark and dust. At dawn, the KRRC had not reached its objective and had to find cover and dig in some distance from Woodcock. 2nd Rifle Brigade had had better fortune and after following the shell bursts of the supporting artillery dug in when they concluded they had reached their objective having encountered little opposition.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=54}}

At 06:00, the 2nd Armoured Brigade commenced its advance and ran into such stiff opposition that, by noon, it had still not linked with the KRRC. The 24th Armoured Brigade started a little later and was soon in contact with the Rifle Brigade (having shelled them in error for a while). Some hours of confused fighting ensued involving tanks from the ''Littorio'' and troops and anti-tank guns from 15th Panzer which managed to keep the British armour at bay in spite of the support of the Rifle Brigade battle group's anti-tank guns. Rommel had decided to make two counter-attacks using his fresh troops. 90th Light Division was to make a fresh attempt to capture Point 29 and 21st Panzer were targeted at Snipe (the ''Ariete'' detachment had returned south).{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=54–55}}

At Snipe, mortar and shellfire was constant all day long. At 16:00, Rommel launched his major attack. German and Italian tanks moved forward. Against them the Rifle Brigade had 13 6-pounder anti-tank guns along with six more from the supporting 239th Anti-Tank Battery, RA. Although on the point of being overrun more than once they held their ground, destroying 22 German and 10 Italian tanks. The Germans gave up but in error the British battle group was withdrawn without being replaced that evening. Its CO, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Victor Buller Turner]], was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=56}} Only one anti-tank gun—from 239 Battery—was brought back.{{sfn|Lucas-Phillips|1962|p=296}}

When it was discovered that neither Woodcock nor Snipe was in Eighth Army hands, 133rd Lorried Infantry Brigade was sent to capture them. By 01:30 on 28 October, the 4th battalion [[Royal Sussex Regiment]] judged they were on Woodcock and dug in. At dawn, 2nd Armoured Brigade moved up in support but before contact could be made 4th Royal Sussex were counter-attacked and overrun with many losses. Meanwhile, the Lorried Brigade's two other battalions had moved on Snipe and dug in, only to find out the next day that they were in fact well short of their objective.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=56–57}}

Further north, the 90th Light Division's attack on Point 29 during the afternoon of 27 October failed under heavy artillery and bombing which broke up the attack before it had closed with the Australians. The action at Snipe was an episode of the Battle of El Alamein described by the regiment's historian as the most famous day of the regiment's war.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=56, 54}} Lucas-Phillips, in his ''Alamein'' records that:

{{quote|The desert was quivering with heat. The gun detachments and the platoons squatted in their pits and trenches, the sweat running in rivers down their dust-caked faces. There was a terrible stench. The flies swarmed in black clouds upon the dead bodies and excreta and tormented the wounded. The place was strewn with burning tanks and carriers, wrecked guns and vehicles, and over all drifted the smoke and the dust from bursting high explosives and from the blasts of guns.|Lucas-Phillips|{{sfn|Lucas-Phillips|1962|p=285}}}}

====D + 5–6: 28–29 October====
[[File:Valentine tank Mk3 desert.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Valentine tank]] in North Africa, carrying British infantry]]
On 28 October, 15th and 21st Panzer made a determined attack on the X Corps front but were halted by sustained artillery, tank and anti-tank gun fire. In the afternoon, they paused to regroup to attack again but they were bombed for two and a half hours and were prevented from even forming up.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=57}} This proved to be Rommel's last attempt to take the initiative and as such his defeat here represented a turning point in the battle.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=441}}

At this point, Montgomery ordered the X Corps formations in the Woodcock-Snipe area to go over to defence while he focused his army's attack further to the north. Late on 27 October, the British 133rd Brigade was sent forward to recover lost positions but the next day, a good part of this force was overrun by German and Italian tanks from the Littorio and supporting [[12th Bersaglieri Regiment]] and several hundred British soldiers were captured.{{sfn|Walker|2006|p=166}} On the night of 28/29 October, the [[Australian 9th Division|9th Australian Division]] was ordered to make a second set-piece attack. The [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Australian Infantry Brigade]] with 40th R.T.R. in support would push north-west from Point 29 to form a base for [[26th Brigade (Australia)|26th Australian Infantry Brigade]] with 46th R.T.R. in support, to attack north-east to an Axis location south of the railway known as Thompson's Post and then over the railway to the coast road, where they would advance south-east to close on the rear of the Axis troops in the coastal salient. An attack by the third brigade would then be launched on the salient from the south-east.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=58}}

The 20th Brigade took its objectives with little trouble but 26th Brigade had more trouble. Because of the distances involved, the troops were riding on 46th R.T.R. [[Valentine tank]]s as well as carriers, which mines and anti-tank guns soon brought to grief, forcing the infantry to dismount. The infantry and tanks lost touch with each other in fighting with the 125th ''Panzergrenadier'' Regiment and a battalion of [[7th Bersaglieri Regiment]] sent to reinforce the sector and the advance came to a halt.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=58}} The Australians suffered 200 casualties in that attack and suffered 27 killed and 290 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/atwar/remembering1942/alamein23/transcript.htm |title=The Battle of El Alamein, 23 October 1942|work=Remembering 1942|first=Dr. Mark|last= Johnston|publisher=Australian War Memorial, Canberra|date=23 October 2002|accessdate=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German and Italian forces that had participated in the counter-attack formed an outpost and held on until the arrival of German reinforcements on 1 November.

[[File:The British Army in North Africa 1942 E18684.jpg|thumb|British Grant tank moving up to the front, 29 October 1942]]
It became clear that there were no longer enough hours of darkness left to reform, continue the attack and see it to its conclusion, so the operation was called off. By the end of these engagements in late October, the British had 800 tanks still in operation, while the ''Panzerarmee'' day report for 28 October (intercepted and read by Eighth Army the following evening) recorded 81 serviceable German tanks and 197 Italian.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=441}} With the help of signals intelligence information the ''Proserpina'' (carrying 4,500 tonnes of fuel) and ''Tergestea'' (carrying 1,000 tonnes of fuel and 1,000 tonnes of ammunition) had been destroyed on 26 October and the tanker ''Luisiano'' (carrying 2,500 tonnes of fuel) had been sunk off the west coast of Greece by a torpedo from a Wellington bomber on 28 October.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=58, 63}} Rommel told his commanders, "It will be quite impossible for us to disengage from the enemy. There is no gasoline for such a manoeuvre. We have only one choice and that is to fight to the end at Alamein."{{sfn|Vivian|2000|p=279}}

These actions by the Australians and British had alerted Montgomery that Rommel had committed his reserve in the form of 90th Light Division to the front and that its presence in the coastal sector suggested that Rommel was expecting the next major Eighth Army offensive in this sector. Montgomery determined therefore that it would take place further south on a {{convert|4000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} front south of Point 29. The attack was to take place on the night of 31 October/1 November, as soon as he had completed the reorganisation of his front line to create the reserves needed for the offensive (although in the event it was postponed by 24 hours). To keep Rommel's attention on the coastal sector, Montgomery ordered the renewal of the 9th Australian Division operation on the night of 30/31 October.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=59}}

====D + 7–9: 30 October – 1 November====
[[File:Montgomery watches his tanks move up.jpg|thumb|[[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]] watches Allied tanks advance (November 1942)]]
The night of 30 October saw the third Australian attempt to reach the paved road and by the end of the night they were astride the road and the railway, making the position of the Axis troops in the salient precarious. A battle group from the 21. {{lang|de|Panzer-Division}} launched four attacks against "Thompson's Post" on 31 October, all being repulsed. Sergeant [[William Henry Kibby|William Kibby]] ([[2/48th Battalion (Australia)|2/48th Infantry Battalion]]) who, for his heroic actions from the 23rd until his death on the 31 October, including a lone attack on a machine-gun position at his own initiative, was awarded the Victoria Cross (posthumous). On 1 November, contact with {{lang|de|Panzergrenadier-Regiment}} 125 in the nose of the salient was restored; the supporting 10° {{lang|it|Battaglione Bersaglieri}} resisted several Australian attacks.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=61–62}}{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=380}} 

On 1 November, the tankers ''Tripolino'' and ''Ostia'' were torpedoed and sunk from the air north-west of Tobruk. The shortage forced him to rely increasingly on fuel flown in from [[Crete]] on the orders of [[Albert Kesselring]], {{lang|de|Luftwaffe [[OB Süd|Oberbefehlshaber Süd]]}} (OB {{lang|de|Süd}}, Supreme Commander South), despite the restrictions imposed by the bombing of the airfields in Crete and Desert Air Force interceptions of the transport aircraft.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=63}} Rommel began to plan a retreat anticipating retiring to Fuka, some {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} west, as he had only 90 tanks remaining, against 800 British tanks.{{sfn|Young|1966|p=261}} Large amounts of fuel arrived at Benghazi after the German forces had started to retreat but little of it reached the front, a fact Kesselring tried to change by delivering it more closely to the fighting forces.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=26}}

===Phase four: Operation Supercharge===

====D + 10: 2 November====
[[File:Priest of 1st Armoured Division in North Africa, 2 November 1942 (E 18869).jpg|thumb|A [[M7 Priest|Priest 105 mm self-propelled gun]] of the 1st Armoured Division preparing for action, 2 November 1942]]
This phase of the battle began at 01:00 on 2 November, with the objective of destroying enemy armour, forcing the enemy to fight in the open, reducing the Axis stock of petrol, attacking and occupying enemy supply routes, and causing the disintegration of the enemy army. The intensity and the destruction in Supercharge were greater than anything witnessed so far during this battle. The objective of this operation was Tel el Aqqaqir, the base of the Axis defence roughly {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} north-west of the Kidney feature and situated on the Rahman lateral track.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|loc=Map 10}}

The initial thrust of Supercharge was to be carried out by the 2nd New Zealand Division. Lieutenant-General Bernard Freyberg, had tried to free them of this task, as they had lost 1,405 men in just three days, at El Ruweisat Ridge in July. However, in addition to its own 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade and 28th (Maori) Infantry Battalion, the division was to have had placed under its command [[151st Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|151st (Durham) Brigade]] from 50th Division, [[152nd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|152nd (Seaforth and Camerons) Brigade]] from 51st Division and the [[133rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|133rd Royal Sussex Lorried Infantry Brigade]]. In addition, the division was to have [[British 9th Armoured Brigade]] under command.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=64–65}}

As in Operation Lightfoot, it was planned that two infantry brigades (the 151st on the right and 152nd on the left) each this time supported by a regiment of tanks—the 8th and 50th Royal Tank Regiments—would advance and clear a path through the mines. Once they reached their objectives, {{convert|4000|yd|m|abbr=on}} distant, 9th Armoured Brigade would pass through supported by a heavy artillery barrage and break open a gap in the Axis defences on and around the Rahman track, some {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}} further forward, which the 1st Armoured Division, following behind, would pass through into the open to take on Rommel's armoured reserves.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=64– 65}} Rommel had ordered 21st Panzer Division from the front line on 31 October to form a mobile counterattacking force. The division had left behind a ''panzergrenadier'' regiment which would bolster the [[101 Motorised Division Trieste|''Trieste'' Division]] which had been ordered forward to replace it. Rommel had also interspersed formations from the ''Trieste'' and 15th Panzer Divisions to "corset" his weaker forces in the front line. On 1 November the two German armoured divisions had 102 effective tanks to face Supercharge and the ''Littorio'' and ''Trieste'' Divisions had 65 tanks between them.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|p=445}}

Supercharge started with a seven-hour aerial bombardment focused on Tel el Aqqaqir and [[Sidi Abdel Rahman|Sidi Abd el Rahman]], followed by a four and a half-hour barrage of 360 guns firing 15,000 shells.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} The two assault brigades started their attack at 01:05 on 2 November and gained most of their objectives to schedule and with moderate losses. On the right of the main attack 28th (Maori) battalion captured positions to protect the right flank of the newly formed salient and 133rd Lorried Infantry did the same on the left. New Zealand engineers cleared five lines through the mines allowing the [[Royal Dragoons]] armoured car regiment to slip out into the open and spend the day raiding the Axis communications.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=66}}

The 9th Armoured Brigade had started its approach march at 20:00 on 1 November from El Alamein railway station with around 130 tanks and arrived at its start line with only 94 runners (operational tanks). The brigade was to have started its attack towards Tel el Aqqaqir at 05:45 behind a barrage; the attack was postponed for 30 minutes while the brigade regrouped on [[John Cecil Currie|Currie's]] orders.{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=387}} At 06:15, 30 minutes before dawn, the three regiments of the brigade advanced towards the gun line.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=66–67}}

{{quote|We all realise that for armour to attack a wall of guns sounds like another [[Charge of the Light Brigade|Balaclava]], it is properly an infantry job. But there are no more infantry available. So our armour must do it.|Lieutenant General Sir Bernard Freyberg{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=386}}}}

Brigadier Currie had tried to get the brigade out of doing this job, stating that he believed the brigade would be attacking on too wide a front with no reserves and that they would most likely have 50 percent losses.{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=386}}

The reply came from Freyberg that Montgomery

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;was aware of the risk and has accepted the possibility of losing 100% casualties in [[9th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|9th Armoured Brigade]] to make the break, but in view of the promise of immediate following through of the 1st Armoured Division, the risk was not considered as great as all that.|Freyberg{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=386}}}}

The German and Italian anti-tank guns (mostly [[5 cm PaK 38|Pak38]] and [[Cannone da 47/32 M35|Italian 47 mm]] guns, along with 24 of the formidable [[88 mm gun|88 mm flak guns]]) opened fire upon the charging tanks silhouetted by the rising sun.{{sfn|Walker|1967|p=395}}{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=386}} German tanks, which had penetrated between the Warwickshire Yeomanry and [[Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry]], also caused many casualties. British tanks attacking the ''Folgore'' sector were fought off with [[petrol bombs]] and mortar fire as well as with the obsolete Italian 47&amp;nbsp;mm cannons. The Axis gun screen started to inflict a steady amount of damage upon the advancing tanks but was unable to stop them; over the course of the next 30 minutes, around 35 guns were destroyed and several hundred prisoners taken. The 9th Armoured Brigade had started the attack with 94 tanks and was reduced to only 14 operational tanks{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=67}} and of the 400 tank crew involved in the attack, 230 were killed, wounded or captured.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=24}}

After the Brigade's action, Brigadier Gentry of 6th New Zealand Brigade went ahead to survey the scene. On seeing Brigadier Currie asleep on a stretcher, he approached him saying, "Sorry to wake you John, but I'd like to know where your tanks are?" Currie waved his hand at a group of tanks around him and replied "There they are". Gentry said "I don't mean your headquarters tanks, I mean your armoured regiments. Where are they?" Currie waved his arm and again replied, "There are my armoured regiments, Bill".{{sfn|Lucas-Phillips|1962|p=358}}

The brigade had sacrificed itself upon the gun line and caused great damage but had failed to create the gap for the 1st Armoured Division to pass through; however, soon after dawn 1st Armoured Division started to deploy and the remains of 9th Armoured Brigade came under its command. 2nd Armoured Brigade came up behind the 9th, and by mid-morning 8th Armoured Brigade had come up on its left, ordered to advance to the south-west.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=67}} In heavy fighting during the day the British armour made little further progress. At 11:00 on 2 November, the remains of 15th Panzer, 21st Panzer and ''Littorio'' Armoured Divisions counter-attacked 1st Armoured Division and the remains of 9th Armoured Brigade, which by that time had dug in with a screen of anti-tank guns and artillery together with intensive air support. The counter-attack failed under a blanket of shells and bombs, resulting in a loss of some 100 tanks.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=24}}

[[File:The Campaign in North Africa 1940-1943 E18485.jpg|thumb|German prisoners brought in from the battle]]
Although X Corps had failed in its attempt to break out, it had succeeded in its objective of finding and destroying enemy tanks. Although tank losses were approximately equal, this represented only a portion of the total British armour, but most of Rommel's tanks; the ''Afrika Korps'' strength of tanks fit for battle fell by 70 while in addition to the losses of the 9th Armoured Brigade, the 2nd and 8th Armoured Brigades lost 14 tanks in the fighting, with another 40 damaged or broken down. The fighting was later termed the "Hammering of the Panzers". In the late afternoon and early evening, the 133rd Lorried and 151st Infantry Brigades—by this time back under command of 51st Infantry Division—attacked respectively the Snipe and Skinflint (about a mile west of Snipe) positions in order to form a base for future operations. The heavy artillery concentration which accompanied their advance suppressed the opposition from the ''Trieste'' Division and the operation succeeded with few casualties.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=67–70}}

On the night of 2 November, Montgomery once again reshuffled his infantry in order to bring four brigades (5th Indian, 151st, 5th New Zealand and 154th) into reserve under XXX Corps to prepare for the next thrust. He also reinforced X Corps by moving 7th Armoured Division from army reserve and sending 4th Light Armoured Brigade from XIII Corps in the south. General von Thoma's report to Rommel that night said he would have at most 35 tanks available to fight the next day and his artillery and anti-tank weapons had been reduced to ⅓ of their strength at the start of the battle. Rommel concluded that to forestall a breakthrough and the resulting destruction of his whole army he must start withdrawing to the planned position at Fuka. He called up [[Italian 132nd Armored Division Ariete|''Ariete'']] from the south to join the mobile Italian XX Corps around Tel el Aqqaqir. His mobile forces (XX Corps, ''Afrika Korps'', 90th Light Division and 19th ''Flak'' Division) were ordered to make a fighting withdrawal while his other formations were to withdraw as best they could with the limited transport available.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=68–69}}

====D + 11: 3 November====
At 20:30 on 2 November, Lumsden decided that one more effort by his X Corps would see the gun screen on the Rahman track defeated and ordered 7th Motor Brigade to seize the track along a {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} front north of Tell el Aqqaqir. The 2nd and 8th Armoured Brigades would then pass through the infantry to a distance of about {{convert|3.5|mi|km|abbr=on}}. On the morning of 3 November 7 Armoured Division would pass through and swing north heading for the railway at Ghazal station. 7th Motor Brigade set off at 01:15 on 3 November, but having received its orders late, had not had the chance to reconnoitre the battle area in daylight. This combined with stiff resistance led to the failure of their attack. As a consequence, the orders for the armour were changed and 2nd Armoured Brigade was tasked to support the forward battalion of 133rd Lorried Brigade (2nd King's Royal Rifle Corps) and 8th Armoured Brigade was to push south-west. Fighting continued throughout 3 November, but 2nd Armoured was held off by elements of the ''Afrika Korps'' and tanks of the ''Littorio'' Division. Further south, 8th Armoured Brigade was held off by anti-tank units helped later by tanks of the arriving ''Ariete'' Division.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=70–71}}

===Phase five: the break-out===
[[File:Sherman tanks of the Eighth Army move across the desert.jpg|thumb|left|Sherman tanks of the Eighth Army move across the desert]]

On 2 November, Rommel signalled to Hitler that

{{quote|The army's strength was so exhausted after its ten days of battle that it was not now capable of offering any effective opposition to the enemy's next break-through attempt&amp;nbsp;... With our great shortage of vehicles an orderly withdrawal of the non-motorised forces appeared impossible&amp;nbsp;... In these circumstances we had to reckon, at the least, with the gradual destruction of the army.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=319}}}}

and at 13.30 on 3 November Rommel received a reply,

{{quote|To Field Marshal Rommel. It is with trusting confidence in your leadership and the courage of the German-Italian troops under your command that the German people and I are following the heroic struggle in Egypt. In the situation which you find yourself there can be no other thought but to stand fast, yield not a yard of ground and throw every gun and every man into the battle. Considerable air force reinforcements are being sent to C.-in-C South. The ''Duce'' and the ''Commando Supremo'' are also making the utmost efforts to send you the means to continue the fight. Your enemy, despite his superiority, must also be at the end of his strength. It would not be the first time in history that a strong will has triumphed over the bigger battalions. As to your troops, you can show them no other road than that to victory or death. Adolf Hitler.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=321}}}}

Rommel thought the order (similar to one that had been given at the same time by [[Benito Mussolini]] through {{lang|it|Comando Supremo}}),

{{quote|demanded the impossible.&amp;nbsp;... We were completely stunned, and for the first time in the African campaign I did not know what to do. A kind of apathy took hold of us as we issued orders for all existing positions to be held on instructions from the highest authority.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=321}}}}

Rommel ordered the Italian X and XXI Corps and the 90th Light Division to hold while the {{lang|de|Afrika Korps}} withdrew approximately {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} west during the night of 3 November. The Italian XX Corps and the {{lang|it|Ariete}} Division conformed to their position and Rommel replied to Hitler confirming his determination to hold the battlefield. The Desert Air Force continued its bombing and in its biggest day of the battle it flew 1,208 sorties and dropped {{convert|396|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} of bombs.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=73–74}}

On the night of 3/4 November, Montgomery ordered three of the infantry brigades in reserve to advance on the Rahman track as a prelude to an armoured break-out. At 17:45, the 152nd Infantry Brigade with the 8th RTR in support, attacked about {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Tel el Aqqaqir. The 5th Indian Infantry Brigade was to attack the track {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}} further south during the early hours of 4 November; at 06:15, the 154th Infantry Brigade was to attack Tel el Aqqaqir. The 152nd Infantry Brigade was mistakenly told the Axis had withdrawn from their objectives and unexpectedly met determined resistance. Communications failed and the forward infantry elements ended up digging in well short of their objective. By the time the 5th Indian Brigade set off, the defenders had begun to withdraw and their objective was taken virtually unopposed. By the time the 154th Brigade moved into some artillery-fire, the Axis had left.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=75}}

====D + 12, 4 November====
[[File:88 mm Flak 36 near El Aqqaqir 1942.jpg|thumb|A captured 88 mm Flak 36 near El Aqqaqir, November 1942]]
On 4 November, the Eighth Army plan for pursuit began at dawn; no fresh units were available and the 1st and 7th Armoured divisions were to turn northwards to roll up the Axis units still in the forward lines. The 2nd New Zealand Division with two lorried infantry brigades and the 9th Armoured and 4th Light Armoured brigades under command, was to head west along desert tracks to the escarpment above Fuka, about {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} away. The New Zealanders got off to a slow start because its units were dispersed after the recent fighting and took time to concentrate. Paths through the minefields were congested and had deteriorated, which caused more delays. By dark, the division was only {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of the Rahman track, the 9th Armoured Brigade was still at the track and the 6th New Zealand Brigade even further back.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=81, 83}}

The plan to trap the 90th Light Division with the 1st and 7th Armoured divisions misfired. The 1st Armoured Division came into contact with the remnants of 21st Panzer Division and had to spend most of the day pushing them back {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The 7th Armoured Division was held up by the {{lang|it|Ariete}} Armoured Division, which was destroyed conducting a determined resistance.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=84}} In his diary, Rommel wrote

{{quote|Enormous dust-clouds could be seen south and south-east of headquarters [of the DAK], where the desperate struggle of the small and inefficient Italian tanks of XX Corps was being played out against the hundred or so British heavy tanks which had come round their open right flank. I was later told by Major von Luck, whose battalion I had sent to close the gap between the Italians and the Afrika Korps, that the Italians, who at that time represented our strongest motorised force, fought with exemplary courage. Tank after tank split asunder or burned out, while all the time a tremendous British barrage lay over the Italian infantry and artillery positions. The last signal came from the {{lang|it|Ariete}} at about 15.30 hours ''"Enemy tanks penetrated south of Ariete. Ariete now encircled. Location 5&amp;nbsp;km north-west Bir el Abd.

The {{lang|it|Littorio}} Armoured Division and the {{lang|it|Trieste}} Motorised Division were also destroyed.

{{quote|The more we advanced the more we realised that the Italians did not have much fight in them after putting up a strong resistance to our overwhelming advance and they started surrendering to our lead troops in droves.

The {{lang|it|Bologna}} and the remnants of the {{lang|it|Trento}} Division tried to fight their way out and marched into the desert without water, food or transport before surrendering, exhausted and dying from dehydration.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=27}} It was reported that Colonel Arrigo Dall'Olio, commanding the 40th Infantry Regiment of the {{lang|it|Bologna}} Division, surrendered saying, "We have ceased firing not because we haven't the desire but because we have spent every round".{{sfn|Sillavengo|1966|p=130}} In a symbolic act of defiance, no one in 40th {{lang|it|Bologna}} Infantry Regiment raised their hands.

{{quote|It was a terrific letdown by their German allies. They had fought a good fight. In the south, the famed {{lang|it|Folgore}} parachute division fought to the last round of ammunition.

But even that was denied them.

By late morning on 4 November, Rommel realised his situation was desperate,

{{quote|The picture in the early afternoon of the 4th was as follows: powerful enemy armoured forces&amp;nbsp;... had burst a 19-kilometre hole in our front, through which strong bodies of tanks were moving to the west. As a result of this, our forces in the north were threatened with encirclement by enemy formations 20 times their number in tanks&amp;nbsp;... There were no reserves, as every available man and gun had been put into the line. So now it had come, the thing we had done everything in our power to avoid – our front broken and the fully motorised enemy streaming into our rear. Superior orders could no longer count. We had to save what there was to be saved.{{sfn|Rommel|1982|p=325}}}}

Rommel telegraphed Hitler for permission to fall back on Fuka. As further Allied blows fell, Thoma was captured and reports came in from the {{lang|it|Ariete}} and {{lang|it|Trento}} divisions that they were encircled. At 17:30, unable to wait any longer for a reply from Hitler, Rommel gave orders to retreat.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=84}}

Due to lack of transport, most of the Italian infantry formations were abandoned.{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2003|loc=chapter 27}}{{sfn|Bauer|2000|p=372}} Any chance of getting them away with an earlier move had been spoiled by Hitler's insistence that Rommel hold his ground, obliging him to keep the non-motorised Italian units well forward until it was too late.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=73}} To deepen the armoured thrusts, the 1st Armoured Division was directed at El Daba, {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} down the coast and the 7th Armoured Division towards Galal, a further {{convert|24|km|abbr=on}} west along the railway. The New Zealand Division group had hoped to reach their objective by mid-morning on 5 November but was held up by artillery-fire when picking their way through what turned out to be a dummy minefield and the 15th Panzer Division got there first.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=86–87}}

====D + 13, 5 November====

The 7th Armoured Division was ordered cross-country to cut the coast road at Sidi Haneish, {{convert|65|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of the Rahman track, while the 1st Armoured Division, west of El Dada, was ordered to take a wide detour through the desert to Bir Khalda, {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of the Rahman track, preparatory to turning north to cut the road at Mersa Matruh. Both moves failed, the 7th Armoured Division finished the day {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} short of its objective. The 1st Armoured Division tried to make up time with a night march but in the darkness the armour became separated from their support vehicles and ran out of fuel at dawn on 6 November, {{convert|16|mi|km|abbr=on}} short of Bir Khalda. The DAF continued to fly in support but because of the dispersion of X Corps, it was difficult to establish bomb lines, beyond which, aircraft were free to attack.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=87–88}}

====D + 14, 6 November====
By 11:00 on 6 November, the "B" Echelon support vehicles began to reach the 1st Armoured Division but with only enough fuel to replenish two of the armoured regiments, which set off again hoping to be in time to cut off the Axis. The regiments ran out of fuel again, {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=on}} south-west of Mersa Matruh. A fuel convoy had set out from Alamein on the evening of 5 November but progress was slow as the tracks had become very cut up. By midday on 6 November, it began to rain and the convoy bogged {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the rendezvous with the 1st Armoured Division "B".{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=89–90}} The 2nd New Zealand Division advanced toward Sidi Haneish while the 8th Armoured Brigade, 10th Armoured Division, had moved west from Galal to occupy the landing fields at Fuka and the escarpment. Roughly {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} south-west of Sidi Haneish, the 7th Armoured Division encountered the 21st Panzer Division and the ''Voss'' Reconnaissance Group that morning. In a running fight, the 21st Panzer Division lost 16 tanks and numerous guns, narrowly escaping encirclement and reached Mersa Matruh that evening. It was again difficult to define bomb lines but US heavy bombers attacked Tobruk, sinking {{lang|it|Etiopia}} [{{convert|2153|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=on}}] and later attacked Benghazi, sinking {{lang|it|Mars}} and setting the tanker {{lang|it|Portofino}} (6,572 GRT), alight.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=90}}

[[File:The British Army in North Africa 1942 E19174.jpg|thumb|A German 88 mm gun abandoned near the coast road, west of El Alamein, 7 November 1942]]
On 7 November, waterlogged ground and lack of fuel stranded the 1st and 7th Armoured divisions. The 10th Armoured Division, on the coast road and with ample fuel, advanced to Mersa Matruh while its infantry mopped up on the road west of Galal.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=91}} Rommel intended to fight a delaying action at [[Sidi Barrani]], {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Matruh, to gain time for Axis troops to get through the bottlenecks at Halfaya and Sollum.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=93}} The last rearguards left Matruh on the night of 7/8 November but were only able to hold Sidi Barrani until the evening of 9 November. By the evening of 10 November, the 2nd New Zealand Division, heading for Sollum, had the 4th Light Armoured Brigade at the foot of the Halfaya Pass while 7th Armoured Division was conducting another detour to the south, to take Fort Capuzzo and Sidi Azeiz. On the morning of 11 November, the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade captured the pass, taking 600 Italian prisoners. By nightfall on 11 November, the Egyptian wall was clear but Montgomery was forced to order that the pursuit should temporarily be continued only by armoured cars and artillery, because of the difficulty in supplying larger formations west of Bardia.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=94–95}}

El Alamein was an Allied victory,&lt;!--''Decisive'' isn't supported by the citation--&gt; although Rommel did not lose hope until the end of the [[Tunisia Campaign]]. Churchill said,

{{quote|It may almost be said, "Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein we never had a defeat".|sign=Winston Churchill.{{sfn|Churchill|1950|p=603}}}}

The Allies frequently had numerical superiority in the Western Desert but never had it been so complete in quantity and quality. With the arrival of [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]], [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|6-pounder]] anti-tank guns and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] in the Western Desert, the Allies gained a comprehensive superiority.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=76}} Montgomery envisioned the battle as an attrition operation, similar to those fought in the [[First World War]] and accurately predicted the length of the battle and the number of Allied casualties. Allied artillery was superbly handled and Allied air support was excellent, in contrast to the ''Luftwaffe'' and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'', which offered little or no support to ground forces, preferring to engage in air-to-air combat. Air supremacy had a huge effect on the battle. Montgomery wrote,

{{quote|The moral effect of air action [on the enemy] is very great and out of all proportion to the material damage inflicted. In the reverse direction, the sight and sound of our own air forces operating against the enemy have an equally satisfactory effect on our own troops. A combination of the two has a profound influence on the most important single factor in war—morale.|Montgomery{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=63}}}}

Historians debate the reasons Rommel decided to advance into Egypt. In 1997, Martin van Creveld wrote that Rommel had been advised by the German and Italian staffs that his army could not properly be supplied so far from the ports of Tripoli and [[Benghazi]]. Rommel pressed ahead with his advance to Alamein and as predicted, supply difficulties limited the attacking potential of the axis forces.{{sfn|Creveld|1997|p=196}} According to Maurice Remy (2002), Hitler and Mussolini put pressure on Rommel to advance. Rommel had been very pessimistic, especially after the First Battle of El Alamein, and knew that as US supplies were en route to Africa and Axis ships were being sunk in the Mediterranean, the Axis was losing a race against time. On 27 August, Kesselring promised Rommel that supplies would arrive in time but Westphal pointed out that such an expectation would be unrealistic and the offensive should not begin until they had arrived. After a conversation with Kesselring on 30 August, Rommel decided to attack, "the hardest [decision] in my life".{{sfn|Remy|2002|pp=111–116}}

Chief of staff [[Luigi Binelli Mantelli]] stated: "The spirit of service and cohesion are fundamental elements for the operational capacity of the armed forces ... The ([[185th Paratroopers Division Folgore|Folgore]]) Paratroopers have always shown this.

[[Winston Churchill]] included the following excerpt in a speech he made to the House of Commons a month after El Alamein: "We must honour the men that were the Lions of the Folgore".&lt;ref name="Alamein" /&gt; Historian John Bierman claimed that the Italian tank regiments "fought with great audacity, just as the Ariete artillery regiment did".&lt;ref name="Alamein"/&gt; On 30 October 2012, a historical park was unveiled on the battle site to show visitors key points in the Egyptian desert. [[Padua University]] has worked with 266 volunteers on the project, which also aims to protect the site from commercial expansion and development. A major exhibition on the battle was staged in [[Milan]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="Alamein"/&gt;

===Casualties===
[[File:El Alamein Aussie 9th edited.JPG|Memorial to the [[Australian 9th Division|9th Australian Division]] at the El Alamein Cemetery|thumb]]
In 2005, Niall Barr wrote that the {{nowrap|36,939}} {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} casualties, was an estimate because of the chaos of the Axis retreat. British figures, based on Ultra intercepts, gave German casualties as {{nowrap|1,149 killed,}} {{nowrap|3,886 wounded}} and {{nowrap|8,050 men}} captured. Italian losses were {{nowrap|971 dead,}} {{nowrap|933 wounded}} and {{nowrap|15,552 men}} captured. By 11 November, the number of Axis prisoners had risen to {{nowrap|30,000 men.}}{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=404}} In a note to ''The Rommel Papers'', [[Fritz Bayerlein]] (quoting figures obtained from {{lang|de|Offizieller Bericht des Oberkommandos Afrika}}) instead estimated German losses in the battle as 1,100 killed, 3,900 wounded and 7,900 prisoners and Italian losses as 1,200 killed, 1,600 wounded and 20,000 prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/THEROMMELPAPERS/THE%20ROMMEL%20PAPERS_djvu.txt The Rommel Papers]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Italian official history, Axis losses during the battle were 4,000 to 5,000 killed or missing, 7,000 to 8,000 wounded and 17,000 prisoners; during the retreat the losses rose to 9,000 killed or missing, 15,000 wounded and 35,000 prisoners.{{sfn|Montanari|1993|p=838}} According to General Giuseppe Rizzo, total Axis casualties included 25,000 men killed or wounded (including 5,920 Italians killed) and 30,000 prisoners (20,000 Italians and 10,724 Germans), 510 tanks and 2,000 field guns, anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft guns.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Rizzo, ''Buche e croci nel deserto'', Verona, 1969, p. 549.&lt;/ref&gt; Axis tank losses were {{circa|500;}} on 4 November, only {{nowrap|36 German}} tanks were left out of the {{nowrap|249 at}} the beginning of the battle. About half of the {{nowrap|278 Italian}} tanks had been lost and most of the remainder were knocked out on the next day by the 7th Armoured Division. About {{nowrap|254 Axis}} guns were lost, along with {{nowrap|64 German}} and {{nowrap|20 Italian}} aircraft.{{sfn|Barr|2005|p=404}}{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=78–79}}

The Eighth Army had {{nowrap|13,560 casualties,}} of whom {{nowrap|2,350 men}} had been killed, {{nowrap|8,950 wounded}} and {{nowrap|2,260 were}} missing; {{nowrap|58 percent}} of the casualties were British, {{nowrap|22 percent}} Australian, {{nowrap|10 percent}} New Zealanders, {{nowrap|6 percent}} South African, {{nowrap|1 percent}} Indian and {{nowrap|3 percent}} Allied forces. The Eighth Army lost from {{nowrap|332 to 500}} tanks, although by the end of the battle, {{nowrap|300}} had been repaired. The artillery lost {{nowrap|111 guns}} and the DAF lost {{nowrap|77 British}} and {{nowrap|20 American}} aircraft.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=404, 78}}

===Subsequent operations===
The Eighth Army was surprised by the Axis withdrawal and confusion caused by redeployments between the three corps meant they were slow in pursuit, failing to cut off Rommel at Fuka and [[Mersa Matruh]].{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=30}} The Desert Air Force failed to make a maximum effort to bomb a disorganised and retreating opponent, which on 5 November was within range and confined to the coast road. Supply shortages and a belief that the ''Luftwaffe'' were about to get strong reinforcements, led the DAF to be cautious, reduce the number of offensive sorties on 5 November and protect the Eighth Army.{{sfn|Hinsley|1981|pp=452–453}}

====Battle of El Agheila====
{{main|Battle of El Agheila}}

[[File:WesternDesertBattle Area1941 en.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Area of [[Western Desert Campaign]] 1941–1942]]
The Axis made a fighting withdrawal to El Agheila but the Axis troops were exhausted and had received few replacements, while Montgomery had planned to transport material over great distances, to provide the Eighth Army with {{convert|2400|t|ST|0|abbr=on}} of supplies per day. Huge quantities of engineer stores had been collected to repair the coast road; the railway line from El Alamein to Fort Capuzzo, despite having been blown up in over 200 places, was quickly repaired. In the month after Eighth Army reached Capuzzo, the railway carried {{convert|133000|ST|t|0|abbr=on}} of supplies. Benghazi handled {{convert|3000|ST|t|0|abbr=on}} a day by the end of December, rather than the expected {{convert|800|ST|t|0|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Clifford|1943|pp=317–318}}

Montgomery paused for three weeks to concentrate his forces and prepare an assault on El Agheila to deny the Axis the possibility of a counter-attack . On 11 December, Montgomery launched the 51st (Highland) Division along the line of the coast road with the 7th Armoured Division on the inland flank. On 12 December the 2nd New Zealand Division started a deeper flanking manoeuvre to cut the Axis line of retreat on the coast road in the rear of the Mersa Brega position.{{sfn|Watson|2007|pp=39, 42}} The Highland Division made a slow and costly advance and 7th Armoured Division met stiff resistance from the ''Ariete'' Combat Group (the remains of the ''Ariete'' Armoured Division). The {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} had lost roughly 75,000 men, 1,000 guns and 500 tanks since the Second Battle of Alamein and withdrew.{{sfn|Clifford|1943|p=319}} By 15 December, the New Zealanders had reached the coast road but the firm terrain allowed Rommel to break his forces into smaller units and withdraw cross-country through the gaps between the New Zealand positions.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=43}}

Rommel conducted a text-book retreat, destroying all equipment and infrastructure left behind and peppering the land behind him with mines and booby traps.{{sfn|Clifford|1943|pp=322, 320}} The Eighth Army reached [[Sirte]] on 25 December but west of the port, were forced to pause to consolidate their strung out formations and to prepare an attack at Wadi Zemzem, near Buerat {{convert|230|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Tripoli.{{sfn|Clifford|1943|pp=325–327}} Rommel had, with the agreement of Field Marshal Bastico, sent a request to the Italian ''Commando Supremo'' in Rome to withdraw to Tunisia where the terrain would better suit a defensive action and where he could link with the Axis army forming there, in response to the [[Operation Torch]] landings. Mussolini replied on 19 December that the {{lang|de|Panzerarmee}} must resist to the last man at Buerat.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=43}}

====Tripoli====
On 15 January 1943, the 51st (Highland) Division made a frontal attack while the 2nd New Zealand Division and the 7th Armoured Division drove around the inland flank of the Axis line. Weakened by the withdrawal of 21st Panzer Division to Tunisia to strengthen the [[5th Panzer Army]] ([[Hans-Jürgen von Arnim]]), Rommel conducted a fighting retreat.{{sfn|Watson|2007|p=44}} The port of Tripoli, {{convert|150|mi|km|abbr=on}} further west, was taken on 23 January as Rommel continued to withdraw to the [[Mareth Line]], the French southern defensive position in Tunisia.

====Tunisia====
{{main|Tunisian campaign}}
Rommel was by this time in contact with the Fifth Panzer Army, which had been fighting against the multi-national [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]] in northern Tunisia, since shortly after Operation Torch. Hitler was determined to retain Tunisia and Rommel finally started to receive replacement men and materials. The Axis faced a war on [[two-front war|two fronts]], with the Eighth Army approaching from the east and the British, French and Americans from the west. The German-Italian Panzer Army was renamed the Italian First Army (General [[Giovanni Messe]]) and Rommel assumed command of the new Army Group Africa, responsible for both fronts.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The two Allied armies were commanded by the [[18th Army Group]] (General Harold Alexander). The [[Run for Tunis#Stalemate|failure]] of the First Army in the [[run for Tunis]] in December 1942 led to a longer [[North African campaign]] which ended when the Italian-German forces in North Africa [[Tunisia Campaign#Axis surrender|capitulated]] in May 1943.
