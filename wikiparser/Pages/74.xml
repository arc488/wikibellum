The '''Raid on Algiers''' took place on 11 December 1942, in the [[Algiers]] harbour. Italian [[Human torpedo|manned torpedoes]] and commando frogmen from the [[Decima Flottiglia MAS]] were brought to Algiers aboard the {{sclass-|Perla|submarine}} ''Ambra''. The participating commandos were captured after setting [[limpet mines]] which sank two [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] ships and damaged two more.

==The raid==
On 4 December 1942, the Italian submarine ''Ambra'' of the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]]'') left the naval base of [[La Spezia]], carrying three manned torpedoes and 10 commando frogmen. Air recoinnassance had discovered that the port of Algiers was crowded with Allied cargo ships, thus the Italian high command had decided to launch a combined operation involving both human torpedoes and combat swimmers carrying limpet mines.&lt;ref&gt;Borghese, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of 10 December, ''Ambra'' reached Algiers at a depth of {{convert|18|m|ft}}. One of the swimmers was employed as scout on the surface, and he guided the submarine toward a position {{convert|2,000|m|ft}} from the southern entrance to the harbour. He spotted six steamers at 21:45, and informed the presence of targets to ''Ambra'' by phone. The other swimmers and the manned torpedoes begun to emerge at 23:45 after some delay. The observer reported an intense reaction from the harbour defences.&lt;ref&gt;Borghese, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; The submarine awaited to recover the operators until 03:00, an hour after the original time set. Then the scout swimmer was recalled on board and ''Ambra'' departed back to La Spezia.&lt;ref&gt;Borghese, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, at 05:00, the explosions started to rock the freighters. ''Ocean Vanquisher'' (7,174&amp;nbsp;tons) and the Norwegian&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?168427 SS Berto (+1942)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Berta'' (1,493&amp;nbsp;tons) sank, while  ''Empire Centaur'' (7,041&amp;nbsp;tons) and ''Armatan'' (4,587&amp;nbsp;tons) were heavily damaged. The American [[Landing Ship Medium|landing ship]] ''LSM-59'' became stranded on the beach. Sixteen Italian divers were captured.&lt;ref&gt;Borghese, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;
