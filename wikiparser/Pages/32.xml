The '''Battle of Gabon''' (French: ''Bataille du Gabon''), also called the '''Gabon Campaign''' (''Campagne du Gabon''),&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, David M. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0bRaa7UuD6EC&amp;dq=battle+of+gabon+world+war+ii&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Library of Congress World War II Companion] p.466&lt;/ref&gt; occurred in November 1940 during [[World War II]]. The battle resulted in the [[Free French Forces]] taking the colony of [[Gabon]] and its capital, [[Libreville]], from [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces. It was the only significant engagement in [[Central Africa]] during the war.

==Background==
In June 1940, Germany invaded and defeated France, and subsequently occupied a portion of the country. [[Philippe Pétain]] established a [[Vichy France|collaborationist government in Vichy]] to administer unoccupied French territory. On 18 June French General [[Charles De Gaulle]] broadcast an appeal over the radio to his compatriots abroad, calling on them to reject the Vichy regime and join the United Kingdom in its war against Germany and Italy. The broadcast provoked division in France's African territories, where colonists were forced to choose sides.{{sfn|Reeves|2016|pp=91–92}}

On 26 August, the governor and military commanders in the colony of [[French Chad|Chad]] announced that they were rallying to De Gaulle's [[Free French Forces]]. A small group of Gaullists seized control of [[French Cameroons|Cameroon]] the following morning, and on 28 August a Free French official ousted the pro-Vichy governor of [[French Congo|Moyen-Congo]]. The next day the governor of [[Ubangi-Shari|Oubangui-Shari]] declared that his territory would support De Gaulle. His declaration prompted a brief struggle for power with a pro-Vichy army officer, but by the end of the day all of the colonies that formed [[French Equatorial Africa]] had rallied to Free France, except for [[Gabon]].{{sfn|Reeves|2016|p=92}} On the evening of 28–29 August 1940, Governor Georges Masson had pledged Gabon's allegiance to Free France. He met immediate opposition from much of [[Libreville]]'s French population and from Gabon's influential, conservative Catholic bishop, Louis Tardy, who favoured Vichy France's anti-[[Freemason]] policies. Facing pressure, Masson was forced to rescind his pledge.{{sfn|Jennings|2015|pp=41–42}} Free French sympathizers were subsequently arrested by the colonial administration and either imprisoned on board the auxiliary cruiser {{MS|Cap des Palmes||2}} or deported to [[Dakar]], Senegal.{{sfn|Jennings|2015|pp=42, 44}} De Gaulle was perturbed by Gabon's refusal to join his cause and described his dilemma in his memoirs: "a hostile enclave, that was hard to reduce because it gave on to the ocean, was created in the heart of our equatorial holdings."{{sfn|Jennings|2015|p=42}} General [[Edgard de Larminat]] stated that the failure to secure the territory would threaten "the very principle of our presence in Africa."{{sfn|Jennings|2015|p=43}}

==Prelude==
On 8 October 1940, De Gaulle arrived in [[Douala]], Cameroon. Four days later he authorised plans for the invasion of French Equatorial Africa. He wanted to use French Equatorial Africa as a base to launch attacks into Axis-controlled [[Libya]]. For this reason, he personally headed northward to survey the situation in [[Chad]], located on the southern border of Libya.&lt;ref name= "World War II-FRENCH-OVERSEAS-EMPIRE"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Second World War in the French Overseas Empire |url= http://worldatwar.net/timeline/france/empire40-45.html |accessdate=27 February 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070211034013/http://worldatwar.net/timeline/france/empire40-45.html |archivedate=11 February 2007 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
[[File:French Equatorial Africa.PNG|thumb|left|[[French Equatorial Africa]]]]
On 27 October, Free French forces crossed into French Equatorial Africa and took the town of [[Mitzic]]. On 5 November, the Vichy garrison at [[Lambaréné]] capitulated. Meanwhile, the main Free French forces under General [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Philippe Leclerc]] and Battalion Chief (major) [[Marie Pierre Koenig]] departed from [[Douala]], [[French Cameroon]]. Their goal was to take Libreville, French Equatorial Africa.&lt;ref name="World War II-FRENCH-OVERSEAS-EMPIRE"/&gt; The British expressed doubt in De Gaulle's ability to establish control over the Vichy territory, but they eventually agreed to lend naval support to the Free French.{{sfn|Jennings|2015|p=44}}{{efn|Jennings speculated that British dissatisfaction with Pétain's handshake with German leader [[Adolf Hitler]] on 24 October crystallised their resolve to lend military aid to Free France.{{sfn|Jennings|2015|p=44}}}}

On 8 November 1940, the {{sclass-|Shoreham|sloop|0}} [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Milford|L51|6}} discovered the Vichy {{sclass-|Redoutable|submarine (1928)|0}} [[submarine]] {{ship|French submarine|Poncelet||2}} shadowing the Anglo-French task force and gave chase. The sloop was too slow to intercept the submarine, so Admiral [[John Cunningham (Royal Navy officer)|Cunningham]] ordered his [[flagship]], {{HMS|Devonshire|39|6}}, to launch its [[Supermarine Walrus]] biplane. The aircraft straddled the submarine with two salvos of 100 lb depth charges as it attempted to dive, damaging it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12047498/Commander-David-Corky-Corkhill-obituary.html|title=Commander David Corky Corkhill obituary|work=Daily Telegraph|date=13 December 2015|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then [[Scuttling|scuttled]] off [[Port-Gentil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Le Masson |first=Henri |year=1969 |series=Navies of the Second World War |title=The French Navy |volume=1 |location=London |publisher=MacDonald &amp; Co.

His forces included French Legionnaires (including the [[13th Foreign Legion Demi-Brigade]]), [[tirailleurs Senegalais|Senegalese]] and Cameroonian troops.&lt;ref name="World War II-FRENCH-OVERSEAS-EMPIRE"/&gt;

On 9 November, Free French [[Westland Lysander]] aircraft operating out of Douala bombed Libreville aerodrome.&lt;ref&gt;Stapleton, Timothy J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XvtDAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s A military History of Africa] p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; The aerodrome was eventually captured, despite stiff resistance met by Koenig's force in its approach.

On 12 November, the final Vichy forces at [[Port Gentil]] surrendered without a fight. Governor Masson – despairing of his actions – committed suicide.&lt;ref name="World War II-FRENCH-OVERSEAS-EMPIRE"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Free French lost four aircraft and six aircrew in the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Bennett, ''The RAF's French Foreign Legion: De Gaulle, the British and the Re-emergence of French Airpower, 1940–45'' (London and New York: Continuum, 2011), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; There is disagreement about the total number of human losses. De Gaulle said "some twenty" died in the campaign. Jean-Christophe Notin claimed 33 were killed. Eliane Ebako wrote that "dozens" lost their lives, while Jean-Pierre Azéma said "roughly one hundred" were killed.{{sfn|Jennings|2015|p=43}}

On 15 November, de Gaulle made a personal appeal that failed to persuade most of the captured Vichy soldiers—including General {{ILL|Marcel Têtu|fr}}—to join the Free French. As a result, they were interned as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] in [[Brazzaville]], [[French Congo]] for the duration of the war.&lt;ref name= "World War II-FRENCH-OVERSEAS-EMPIRE"/&gt;

With their control consolidated in Equatorial Africa, the Free French began focusing on the [[Western Desert Campaign|campaign]] in [[Italian Libya]]. De Gaulle relieved General [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Leclerc]] of his post in Cameroon and sent him to [[N'Djamena|Fort Lamy]], Chad to oversee offensive preparations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bimberg| first = Edward L.| title = Tricolor Over the Sahara: The Desert Battles of the Free French, 1940–1942| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| series = Contributions in military studies| edition = illustrated| date = 2002| pages = 24–26| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5GtlS55tdBAC| isbn = 9780313316548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflict in Gabon triggered a mass migration of Gabonese to [[Spanish Guinea]].{{sfn|Jennings|2015|p=44}} French Equatorial Africa cut its ties with the Vichy-controlled [[French West Africa in World War II|West African territories]], and rebuilt its economy around trade with nearby British possessions, namely [[Colonial Nigeria|Nigeria]].{{sfn|Jennings|2015}} Tensions between Vichy and Free French factions remained long after the invasion.{{sfn|Jennings|2015|p=84}} The seizure of Gabon and the rest of [[French Equatorial Africa]] gave Free France new-found legitimacy. No longer was it an organization of exiles in Britain, as it now had its own sizable territory to govern.{{sfn|Jennings|2015}}
