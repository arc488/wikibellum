'''Operation Compass''' (also '''{{lang|it|la battaglia della Marmarica}}''') was the first large [[United Kingdom|British]] military operation of the [[Western Desert Campaign]] (1940–1943) during the [[Second World War]]. British, Indian, [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and Allied forces attacked [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] forces of the [[tenth Army (Italy)|10th Army]] (Marshal [[Rodolfo Graziani]]) in western [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Cyrenaica]], the eastern province of [[Italian Libya|Libya]], from December 1940 to February 1941.

The [[Western Desert Force]] (WDF) ([[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Richard O'Connor]]) with about {{nowrap|36,000 men,}} advanced from [[Mersa Matruh]] in Egypt on a five-day raid against the Italian positions of the 10th Army, which had about {{nowrap|150,000 men}} in fortified posts around [[Sidi Barrani]] in Egypt and in Cyrenaica. The WDF swiftly defeated the Italians in their fortified posts and at Sidi Barrani and the British exploited their success, forcing the rest of the 10th Army out of Egypt and capturing the ports along the Libyan coast. The 10th Army was cut off as it retreated towards [[Tripolitania]] and defeated at the [[Battle of Beda Fomm]], the remnants being pursued to El Agheila on the [[Gulf of Sirte]].

The British took over {{nowrap|138,000 Italian}} and Libyan prisoners, hundreds of [[tank]]s, and more than {{nowrap|1,000 [[Artillery|guns]]}} and many [[aircraft]], against WDF losses of {{nowrap|1,900 men}} killed and wounded, about {{nowrap|10 per cent}} of the infantry. The WDF was unable to continue beyond El Agheila, due to worn out vehicles and the diversion in March 1941 of the best-equipped units in [[Operation Lustre]] for the [[Battle of Greece]]. Italian reinforcements were rushed to Libya to defend [[Tripoli]], assisted by the {{lang|de|[[Afrika Korps|Deutsches Afrikakorps]]}} and {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}}.

==Background==

===10th Army===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-783-0107-27, Nordafrika, italienischer Panzer L3-33.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Italian [[L3/33]] tankettes in North Africa, April 1941.}}]]
When war was declared, the 5th Army (General [[Italo Gariboldi]]) was in [[Tripolitania]] the western Libyan province and the 10th Army (General [[Mario Berti]]) was in [[Cyrenaica]] to the east. Once the French in Tunisia no longer posed a threat to Tripolitania, units of the 5th Army were used to reinforce the 10th Army. When Governor-General of Libya [[Italo Balbo]] was killed by [[friendly fire]], Marshal Graziani took his place. Graziani expressed doubts about the capabilities of the large non-mechanized force to defeat the British, who though smaller in numbers were motorised. After being reinforced from the 5th Army, the 10th Army controlled the equivalent of four corps with {{nowrap|150,000 infantry,}} {{nowrap|1,600 guns,}} {{nowrap|600 tankettes and tanks}} and {{nowrap|331 aircraft}}.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=266}} The XX Corps had the [[60th Infantry Division Sabratha|60th Infantry Division ''Sabratha'']] and the XXI Corps had the [[1st Blackshirt Division (23 March) (Italy)|1st Blackshirt Division ''23 Marzo'']], the [[2nd Blackshirt Division (28 October) (Italy)|2nd Blackshirt Division ''28 Ottobre'']] and the [[63rd Infantry Division Cirene|63 Infantry Division ''Cirene'']]. XXII Corps had the [[61st Infantry Division Sirte|61st Infantry Division ''Sirte'']] and XXIII Corps had the [[4th Blackshirt Division (3 January) (Italy)|4th Blackshirt Division ''3 Gennaio'']] and the [[64th Infantry Division Catanzaro|64th Infantry Division ''Catanzaro'']].{{sfnm|1a1=Macksey|1y=1972|1pp=106, 121|2a1=Hunt|2y=1990|2p=51}}

The new Group of Libyan Divisions ({{lang|it|Gruppo Divisioni Libiche}}) had the [[Maletti Group]], the [[1st Libyan Division Sibelle|1st Libyan Division ''Sibelle'']] ([[Major-General]] [[Luigi Sibelle]]) and the [[2nd Libyan Division Pescatori|2nd Libyan Division ''Pescatori'']] (Major-General [[Armando Pescatori]]).{{sfn|Hunt|1990|p=51}} The only non-infantry formation was the partially motorised and lightly armoured Maletti Group. The {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Maletti}} ([[General]] [[Pietro Maletti]]) was formed at Derna on 8 July 1940, with seven Libyan motorised infantry battalions, a company of [[Fiat M11/39]] tanks, a company of [[L3/33|L3/33 tankettes]], motorised artillery and supply units as the main motorised unit of the 10th Army. On 29 August, as more tanks arrived from Italy, the {{lang|it|Comando carri della Libia}} (Libyan Tank Command) was formed under the command of Colonel Valentini, with three {{lang|it|Raggruppamenti}}. {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Aresca}} (Colonel Aresca) with the I Medium Tank Battalion and the 31st, 61st and 62nd light tank battalions, {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Trivioli}} (Colonel Antonio Trivioli), with the II Medium Tank Battalion, less one company and the IX, XX, and LXI light tank battalions and {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Maletti}} with the LX light tank battalion and the remaining M11/39 company from the II Medium Tank Battalion.{{sfn|Christie|1999|pp=32, 48}} {{lang|it|Raggruppamento Maletti}} became part of the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali della Libia}} (Royal Corps of Libyan Colonial Troops), with the 1st Libyan Division ''Sibelle'' and the 2nd Libyan Division ''Pescatori''.{{sfn|Walker|2003|p=61}}

===Western Desert Force===

[[File:Mk1CruiserTank.jpg|thumb|{{centre|[[Cruiser Mk I|Cruiser Tank Mk I (A9)]]}}]]
[[Middle East Command]] under General [[Archibald Wavell]] had about {{nowrap|36,000 soldiers,}} some outside Egypt, {{nowrap|120 guns}} and {{nowrap|275 tanks}}. The RAF had {{nowrap|142 aircraft}} in two squadrons of [[Hawker Hurricanes|Hurricanes]], one of [[Gloster Gladiators]], three of [[Bristol Blenheim]]s, three of [[Vickers Wellington]]s and one of [[Bristol Bombay]]s, about {{nowrap|46 fighters}} and {{nowrap|116 bombers.}}{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=262}} The [[Western Desert Force]] (WDF) was commanded by [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Richard O'Connor]] with the [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Infantry Division]] (Major-General [[Noel Beresford-Peirse]]) and the 7th Armoured Division (Major-General Sir [[Michael O'Moore Creagh]]). From 14 December, troops of the [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Australian Infantry Division]] (Major-General [[Iven Giffard Mackay]]), replaced the 4th Indian Division, which was sent to East Africa, less one brigade. The British had some fast [[Cruiser Mk I]], [[Cruiser Mk II]] and [[Cruiser Mk III]] tanks with [[Ordnance QF 2-pounder]] guns, which were superior to Fiat M11/39 tanks. The British also had a battalion of [[Matilda II]] [[infantry tank]]s that while slow, were also equipped with the 2-pounder; the armour of the Matildas could not be penetrated by Italian [[anti-tank gun]]s or field guns.{{sfn|Pitt|1980|p=102}}

===Border skirmishes===
{{main|Fort Capuzzo|Frontier Wire (Libya)}}

[[File:WesternDesertBattle Area1941 en.svg|thumb|{{centre|Area of operations December 1940 to February 1941 (click to enlarge)}}]]
Italy declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]] on 10 June 1940. During the next few months there were raids and skirmishes between Italian forces in Libya and British and Commonwealth forces in Egypt. On 12 June 1940, the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] bombarded Tobruk. The force included the cruisers {{HMS|Liverpool|C11|6}} and {{HMS|Gloucester|62|6}} also exchanged fire with the Italian cruiser [[Italian cruiser San Giorgio|''San Giorgio'']]. Royal Air Force Blenheim bombers from No. 45, No. 55 and No. 211 squadrons, hit ''San Giorgio'' with one bomb.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=112–113}} On 19 June, the British submarine {{HMS|Parthian|N75|6}} fired two torpedoes at ''San Giorgio'' but missed. ''San Giorgio's'' role was then to support the local anti-aircraft units and claimed 47 British aircraft shot down or damaged. ''San Giorgio'' also shot down the [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]] aircraft carrying Italo Balbo, the Governor-General of Libya and Commander-in-chief of Italian forces in North Africa.{{sfn|Hunt|1990|p=21}}

==Prelude==

==={{lang|it|Operazione}} E===
{{Main|Italian invasion of Egypt}}

[[File:AfricaMap1.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Areas of {{lang|it|Operazione}} E and Operation Compass (enlargeable)}}]]
On 13 September 1940, the Italian [[10th Army (Italy)|10th Army]] advanced into Egypt in {{lang|it|Operazione}} E. As the Italians advanced, the small British force at [[As Sallum|Sollum]] withdrew to the main defensive position east of Mersa Matruh.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|pp=26–27}} The Italian advance was harassed by the 3rd Coldstream Guards, attached artillery and other units.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=210}} After recapturing [[Fort Capuzzo]], the Italians advanced approximately {{convert|95|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} in three days and on 16 September, the advance stopped at [[Maktila]], {{convert|16|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} beyond [[Sidi Barrani]]. The Italians dug in and awaited reinforcements and supplies along the {{lang|it|[[Via della Vittoria]]}}, an extension of the {{lang|it|[[Litoranea Balbo]]}} ({{lang|it|Via Balbia}}) being built from the frontier. Five fortified camps were built around Sidi Barrani from Maktila, {{convert|24|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east along the coast, south to Tummar East, Tummar West and Nibeiwa and Sofafi on the escarpment to the south-west.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=27}}

===British plan===

Following the Italian advance, Wavell ordered the commander of British Troops Egypt, Lieutenant-General Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]], to plan a limited operation to push the Italians back. Operation Compass, for administrative reasons, was originally planned as a five-day raid but consideration was given to continuing the operation to exploit success.{{sfnm|1a1=Playfair|1y=1957|1p=264|2a1=Mead|2y=2007|2p=331}} On 28 November, Wavell wrote to Wilson that,

{{quote|I do not entertain extravagant hopes of this operation but I do wish to make certain that if a big opportunity occurs we are prepared morally, mentally and administratively to use it to the fullest.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=265}}}}

The 7th Support Group was to observe the Italian camps on the escarpment around Sofafi, to prevent the garrisons from interfering, while the rest of the division and 4th Indian Division passed through the Sofafi–Nibeiwa gap. An Indian brigade and Infantry tanks of [[7th Royal Tank Regiment]] (7th RTR) would attack Nibeiwa from the west, as the 7th Armoured Division protected their northern flank. Once Nibeiwa was captured, a second Indian brigade and the 7th RTR would attack the Tummars. Selby Force (3rd Battalion [[Coldstream Guards]] plus some artillery) from the Matruh garrison was to contain the enemy camp at Maktila on the coast and the Royal Navy would bombard Maktila and Sidi Barrani.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=260–261}} Preparations were kept secret and only a few officers knew during the training exercise held from {{nowrap|25–26 November,}} that the objectives marked out near Matruh were replicas of Nibeiwa and Tummar; the troops were also told that a second exercise was to follow and did not know that the operation was real until 7 December, as they arrived at their jumping-off points.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=263, 265}}

Late on 8 December, an Italian reconnaissance aircrew reported that attack on Maktila and Nibeiwa was imminent but Maletti was not informed. On 9 December, the 1st Libyan Division ''Sibelle'' was at Maktila and the 2nd Libyan Division ''Pescatori'' was at Tummar. The Maletti Group was at Nibiewa and the 4th Blackshirt Division ''3 Gennaio'' and the headquarters of the Libyan Corps were at Sidi Barrani. The 63rd Infantry Division ''Cirene'' and the headquarters of XXI Corps were at Sofafi and the 64th Infantry Division ''Catanzaro'' was at Buq Buq. The headquarters of the XXIII Corps and the 2nd Blackshirt Division ''28 Ottobre'' were in Sollum and Halfaya Pass respectively and the [[62 Infantry Division Marmarica|62nd Infantry Division ''Marmarica'']] was at Sidi Omar, south of Sollum.{{sfn|Macksey|1972|p=68}} Berti was on sick leave and Gariboldi, the 1st Blackshirt Division ''23 Marzo'' and the 10th Army Headquarters were far back at Bardia. (By the time Berti arrived in Libya, so had the British.){{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=281}} Operation Compass ({{lang|it|la battaglia della Marmarica}}/Battle of the [[Marmarica]]) began on the night of {{nowrap|7/8 December.}} The Western Desert Force with the [[7th Armoured Division]], [[4th Indian Division]] and the [[16th Infantry Brigade]] advanced {{convert|113|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} to their start line. The RAF made attacks on Italian airfields and destroyed or damaged {{nowrap|29 aircraft}} on the ground. Selby Force (Brigadier A. R. Selby) with {{nowrap|1,800 men}} (the maximum for whom transport could be found), moved up from Matruh, set up a brigade of dummy tanks in the desert and reached a position south-east of Maktila by dawn on 9 December. Maktila had been bombarded by the [[monitor (warship)|monitor]] {{HMS|Terror|I03|6}} and the [[Insect class gunboat|gunboat]] {{HMS|Aphis|1915|6}}; Sidi Barrani had been bombarded by the gunboat {{HMS|Ladybird|1916|6}}.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=265–267}}

==Battle of the Camps==

===Nibeiwa===
{{main|Battle of Nibeiwa}}

[[File:Matilda Compass.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|{{centre|A [[Matilda II|Matilda tank]] of the [[7th Royal Tank Regiment]] in the [[Western Desert (North Africa)|Western Desert]].}}]]
At {{nowrap|5:00 a.m.}} on 9 December, a detachment of artillery commenced diversionary fire from the east on the fortified camp at Nibeiwa for an hour, which was held by the Maletti Group and at {{nowrap|7:15 a.m.}} the divisional artillery began a preliminary bombardment. The 11th Indian Infantry Brigade, with 7th RTR under command, attacked Nibeiwa from the north-west, which reconnaissance had established as the weakest sector. By {{nowrap|8:30 a.m.,}} Nibeiwa had been captured; Maletti had been killed in the fighting along with {{nowrap|818 men}} and {{nowrap|1,338}}  wounded; {{nowrap|2,000 Italian}} and Libyan soldiers were taken prisoner.{{sfn|IOH|1979|p=374}} Large quantities of supplies were captured for British casualties of {{nowrap|56 men.}}{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=267–268}}

===The Tummars===

The attack on Tummar West began at {{nowrap|1:50 p.m.,}} after the 7th RTR had refuelled and artillery had bombarded the defences for an hour. Another approach from the north-west was made and tanks broke through the perimeter, followed twenty minutes later by the infantry. The defenders held out for longer than the Nibeiwa garrison but by {{nowrap|4:00 p.m.}} Tummar West was overrun except for the north-eastern corner. The tanks moved on to Tummar East, the greater part of which was captured by nightfall. The  4th Armoured Brigade had advanced to Azziziya, where the garrison of {{nowrap|400 men}} surrendered and light patrols of the [[7th Hussars]] pushed forward to cut the road from Sidi Barrani to Buq Buq, while armoured cars of the 11th Hussars ranged further west. The tanks of 7th Armoured Brigade were held in reserve ready to intercept an Italian counter-attack.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=268–269}} The 2nd Libyan Division lost {{nowrap|26 officers}} and {{nowrap|1,327 men}} killed, {{nowrap|32 officers}} and {{nowrap|804 men}} wounded, with the survivors being taken prisoner.{{sfn|IOH|1979|p=375}}

===Maktila===

Unaware of the situation at the Tummars, Selby sent units to cut the western exits from Maktila but the 1st Libyan Division ''Sibelle'' filtered through and escaped.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=269}} Selby Force followed up the retreat as the 1st Libyan Division moved the {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Maktila to Sidi Barrani and drove part of the column into sand dunes north of the coast road. Cruiser tanks of the [[6th Royal Tank Regiment]] (6th RTR) arrived in a sandstorm and overran the Italians in the dunes at about {{nowrap|5:15 p.m.,}} then joined Selby Force to continue the pursuit. The Italian defenders were caught at Sidi Barrani, in a pocket {{convert|10|by|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} backing on to the sea. When the British attacked again at dawn on 11 December, mass surrenders began everywhere. except at Point 90 where troops of the 2nd Libyan Division ''Pescatori'' held out for a short time, after which {{nowrap|2,000 troops}} surrendered.{{sfn|Pitt|1980|p=114}}

===Sidi Barrani, Buq Buq and Sofafi===

{{main|Battle of Sidi Barrani}}

On 10 December, the 16th Infantry Brigade was brought forward from 4th Indian Division reserve and with part of the 11th Indian Brigade under command, advanced in lorries to attack Sidi Barrani. While moving across exposed ground, some casualties were incurred but with support from artillery and the 7th RTR, it was in position barring the south and south western exits to Sidi Barrani by {{nowrap|1:30 p.m.}} The British attacked at {{nowrap|4:00 p.m.}} supported by the divisional artillery and the town fell by nightfall; the remains of the two Libyan Divisions and the 4th Blackshirt Division ''3 Gennaio'' were trapped between the 16th Infantry Brigade and Selby Force. On 11 December, Selby Force and some tanks attacked and overran the 1st Libyan Division ''Sibelle'' and by the evening, the 4th Blackshirt Division ''3 Gennaio'' had also surrendered. On 11 December, the 7th Armoured Brigade was ordered out of reserve to relieve the 4th Armoured Brigade in the Buq Buq area, mop up and capture large numbers of men and guns. A patrol from the 7th Support Group entered Rabia and found it empty; the 63rd Division ''Cirene'' had withdrawn from Rabia and Sofafi overnight. An order to the 4th Armoured Brigade to cut them off west of Sofafi arrived too late and the Italians were able to retire along the escarpment and join Italian forces at Halfaya.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=270}} Italian casualties were {{nowrap|2,184 men}} killed, {{nowrap|2,287 troops}} wounded and {{nowrap|38,000 prisoners.}}{{sfn|IOH|1979|p=374}}

===Exploitation===

[[File:MatildaII.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|Matilda tank with crew displaying a captured Italian flag}}]]
Over the next few days the [[4th Mechanized Brigade (United Kingdom)|4th Armoured Brigade]], on top of the escarpment and the [[7th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Brigade]] on the coast, attempted a pursuit but supply problems and the large number of prisoners (twenty times the number planned for) impeded the advance. Italian forces crowded along the coast road and retreating from Sidi Barrani and Buq Buq, were bombarded by ''Terror'' and the two gunboats, which fired on the Sollum area all day and most of the night of 11 December. Late on 12 December, the only Italian positions left in Egypt were the approaches to Sollum and the area of Sidi Omar.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=271–273}}

The Italians had lost {{nowrap|38,289 Italian}} and Libyan casualties, most taken prisoner, {{nowrap|73 tanks}} and {{nowrap|237 guns,}} against {{nowrap|634 British}} casualties.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=271–273}} The WDF paused to reorganise and then moved quickly west along the {{lang|it|Via della Vittoria}}, through [[Halfaya Pass]] and re-captured Fort Capuzzo in [[Libya]].{{sfn|Bierman|Smith|2002|p=46}} On 7 December, Wellington bombers from Malta and Blenheim bombers from Egypt carried out raids on the Italian air bases at [[Castel Benito]], [[Benina]] and [[El Adem]], the attack on Castel Benito being particularly successful, with hits on five hangars and strafing runs which hit many Italian aircraft; the attacks continued until the end of the year.{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=270, 273}}

==Pursuit==

===Sollum, Halfaya and Fort Capuzzo===

{{main|Fort Capuzzo}}

[[File:Rolls-Royce Armoured Car Bardia 1940.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|A 1924 [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car]] with modified turret, in the [[Bardia]] area of the Western Desert, 1940.}}]]
Exploitation continued by the two armoured brigades and the 7th Support Group, with the infantry of 16th Infantry Brigade (which had been detached from the 4th Indian Division) following up. By 15 December, [[Sallum|Sollum]] and the Halfaya Pass had been captured and the British by-passed Italian garrisons further south in the desert. Fort Capuzzo, {{convert|40|mi|km|order=flip}} inland at the end of the frontier wire, was captured {{lang|fr|en passant}} by 7th Armoured Division in December 1940, as it advanced westwards to Bardia. The 7th Armoured Division concentrated south-west of Bardia, waiting for the arrival of 6th Australian Division. By this time the WDF had taken {{nowrap|38,300 prisoners}} and captured {{nowrap|237 guns}} and {{nowrap|73 tanks,}} while suffering casualties of {{nowrap|133 killed,}} {{nowrap|387 wounded}} and eight missing.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=273}}

===Bardia===
{{Main|Battle of Bardia}}

The 6th Australian Division ([[Major General (Australia)|Major General]] [[Iven Mackay]]) attacked the Italian XXIII Corps (Lieutenant-General [{{lang|it|[[Generale di Corpo d'Armata]]}}] [[Annibale Bergonzoli]]) at Bardia from 3 to 5 January 1941, assisted by air support, naval gunfire and artillery. The [[16th Brigade (Australia)|16th Australian Infantry Brigade]] attacked at dawn from the west, where the defences were known to be weak. [[Sapper]]s blew gaps in the [[barbed wire]] with [[Bangalore torpedo]]es, then filled in and broke down the sides of the anti-tank ditch with [[Pickaxe|picks]] and [[shovel]]s. The Australian infantry and 23 [[Matilda II (tank)|Matilda II tanks]] of the 7th RTR, overran the Italian defences and took {{nowrap|8,000 prisoners.}} The [[17th Brigade (Australia)|17th Australian Infantry Brigade]] exploited the breach made in the perimeter and pressed south, as far as a secondary line of defences known as the Switch Line. On the second day, the 16th Australian Infantry Brigade captured Bardia, cutting the fortress in two. Thousands of prisoners were taken and the remnants of the Italian garrison held only the northern and southernmost parts of the fortress. On the third day, the [[19th Brigade (Australia)|19th Australian Infantry Brigade]] advanced south from Bardia, supported by artillery and the remaining six Matilda tanks. The 17th Australian Infantry Brigade attacked and the two brigades reduced the southern sector of the fortress. The Italian garrisons in the north surrendered to the 16th Australian Infantry Brigade and the 7th Support Group outside the fortress; about {{nowrap|25,000 prisoners}} were taken, along with {{nowrap|400 guns,}} {{nowrap|130 light}} and medium tanks and hundreds of motor vehicles.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=282–287}} Italian casualties also included {{nowrap|1,703 killed}} and {{nowrap|3,740 men}} wounded.{{sfn|IOH|1979|p=374}}

===Capture of Tobruk===
{{main|British capture of Tobruk}}

===Derna–Mechili===

{{main|Babini Group|Action at Mechili, 24 January 1941}}

[[File:Tobruk Agedabia road2.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Tobruk–Agedabia, 1940–1941}}]]
The area east of the [[Jebel Akhdar (Libya)|Jebel Akhdar]] mountains was garrisoned by XX Corps (Lieutenant-General Annibale Bergonzoli) with the 60th Infantry Division ''Sabratha'' and the Babini Group, which had {{nowrap|120 tanks.}} The tank force included {{nowrap|82 new}} M.13/40 tanks, which needed ten days to be made battle-worthy but had been rushed forward anyway. The ''Sabratha'' Division held a line from Derna, along Wadi Derna to Mechili, with the Babini Group at Mechili, Giovanni Berta and Chaulan, guarding the flank and rear of the infantry.{{sfn|Macksey|1972|pp=121–123}}{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=353}} On 23 January, the 10th Army commander, General [[Giuseppe Tellera]] ordered a counter-attack against the British, to avoid an envelopment of XX Corps from the south. Next day, the Babini Group, with ten to fifteen of the new M.13/40s, attacked the [[7th Queen's Own Hussars|7th Hussars]] as they headed west to cut the Derna–Mechili track north of Mechili. The British swiftly retired, calling for help from the 2nd RTR, which complacently ignored the signals. The British lost several tanks and knocked out two M.13s, until eventually, the 2nd RTR mobilised, caught the Italian tanks sky-lined on a ridge and knocked out seven M.13s, for the loss of a cruiser and six light tanks.{{sfn|Long|1952|p=242}}{{sfn|Macksey|1972|p=123}}

To the north, the 2/11th Australian Battalion engaged the ''Sabratha'' Division and ''Bersaglieri'' companies of the Babini Group at Derna airfield, making slow progress against determined resistance. The 19th Australian Brigade began to arrive in the morning and Italian bombers and fighters attacked the Australians.

[[File:Italian soldiers taken prisoner during Operation Compass.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Italian and Libyan soldiers "in the bag"}}]]
In late January, the British learned that the Italians were retreating along the {{lang|it|Litoranea Balbo}} ({{lang|it|Via Balbia}}) from Benghazi. The 7th Armoured Division was dispatched to intercept the remnants of the 10th Army by moving through the desert, south of the [[Jebel Akhdar, Libya|Jebel Akhdar]] (Green Mountain) via [[Msus]] and [[Antelat]], as the 6th Australian Division pursued the Italians along the coast road, north of the jebel. The terrain slowed the British tanks and Combe Force (Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Frederick Boyce Combe|John Combe]]), a flying column of wheeled vehicles was sent ahead across the chord of the jebel. Late on 5 February, Combe Force arrived at the {{lang|it|Via Balbia}} south of Benghazi and set up road blocks near Sidi Saleh, about {{convert|32|km|mi}} north of Ajedabia and {{convert|48|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} south-west of Antelat; the leading elements of the 10th Army arrived thirty minutes later. Next day, the Italians attacked to break through the roadblock and continued to attack into 7 February. With British reinforcements arriving and the Australians pressing down the road from Benghazi, the remnants of the 10th Army surrendered. From Benghazi to Agedabia, the British took {{nowrap|25,000 prisoners,}} captured {{nowrap|107 tanks}} and {{nowrap|93 guns.}}{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=351–362}}

===Giarabub, Kufra and Uweinat===

{{main|Siege of Giarabub|Capture of Kufra}}

[[File:Carte Koufra.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Map showing Kufra Oasis and Murzuk}}]]
Italian garrisons held Giarabub {{convert|150|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Sollum, Kufra Oasis, Jalo at the west end of the [[Great Sand Sea]] and Murzuk, {{convert|500|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of Tripoli. The oasis of [[Giarabub]] was attacked in January 1941 and captured in March by the 6th Australian Cavalry Regiment and an Australian infantry battalion. Further south, on the far side of the Sand Sea, the oasis of [[Kufra]] was attacked by [[Free French]] from [[French Equatorial Africa]], in concert with [[Long Range Desert Group]] (LRDG) patrols. (Kufra later fell after the two-month [[Battle of Kufra (1941)|Capture of Kufra]] in March 1941.) Further west, on the border with [[Chad]], the Italian base at [[Murzuk]] was raided in January, when a patrol of the new Long Range Patrol Unit and a local sheikh travelled {{convert|1,300|mi|km|abbr=on}} to rendezvous near Kayugi with a small Free French detachment.{{sfn|Pitt|1980|pp=229–240}}{{efn|Cairo to Bahariya Oasis, Ain Dalla, Two Hills/Big Cairn, Murzuk, Traghen, Tummo, Zouar, Faya, Tekro, Sarra, Bishara, Jebel Sherif, Sarra, via Jebel Uweinat to the Nile and Cairo.{{sfn|Pitt|1980|pp=230–231}}}} The force attacked Murzuk and destroyed three aircraft and a hangar; the French commander was killed, most of the Italians surrendered and several prisoners were taken. The raiders then shot up three forts and departed.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=297}}

[[File:Jebel Uweinat.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Jebel Uweinat}}]]
At [[Jebel Uweinat]], a {{convert|6000|ft|m|abbr=on}} massif {{convert|600|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, at the junctions of Egypt, Libya and Sudan, were landing grounds with an Italian garrison. The base was the closest Italian outpost to [[Italian East Africa]] ({{lang|it|Africa Orientale Italiana}}) and an Italian raid from Uweinat on [[Wadi Halfa]] in Sudan was possible. Destruction of the dockyards and railway workshops and the sinking of vessels on the Nile could cut the communications between Khartoum and Cairo.{{sfn|Pitt|1980|p=225}} British patrols visited Faya and rendezvoused with another French detachment with General [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Philippe Leclerc]] for an attack on Kufra. The British were [[Strafing|strafed]] by aircraft and ambushed by armoured cars of an Italian [[Auto-Saharan Company]] ({{lang|it|Auto-Avio-Sahariane}}), which destroyed several lorries. Leclerc decided that an attack on Kufra was not possible and the remaining British returned to Cairo, after a {{nowrap|45-day}} journey of {{convert|4300|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Kufra was captured by the French on 1 March and became the new LRDG base in April.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|p=297}}

The success of the 7th Armoured Division encouraged a belief in the [[Royal Tank Regiment]] that manoeuvre could win battles; the engagement with the [[Babini Group]] on 24 January, led to a conclusion that armoured divisions needed more artillery. No integration of tanks with infantry or the use of anti-tank guns offensively was considered necessary. The lack of cover in the desert encouraged dispersion to avoid air attack but this reduced firepower at the decisive point. Due to the exiguous nature of supply and transport, conservation during lulls also encouraged the use of "[[jock column]]s" (a motorised  infantry company, a field-gun battery and several armoured cars). The success of such columns against the Italians led to exaggerated expectations, which were confounded when German aircraft and better-equipped and -armed troops arrived in Libya. The 7th Armoured Division concluded that the defensive mentality of the Italians had justified the taking of exceptional risks, which would be unjustified against German troops.{{sfn|French|2001|pp=215–216}}

===Casualties===

The WDF suffered casualties of {{nowrap|500 killed,}} {{nowrap|55 missing,}} and {{nowrap|1,373 wounded.}}{{sfn|Wavell|1946|pp=3,268}} The RAF lost {{nowrap|26 aircraft,}} comprising six Hurricanes, five Gladiators, three Wellingtons, a [[Vickers Type 264 Valentia|Valentia]] and eleven Blenheims. A far larger number of aircraft became non-operational due to damage, which could not be repaired quickly for lack of spare parts, a problem made worse by the increased use of explosive bullets by the Italians. (On 14 December, a raid on Bardia by nine Blenheims cost one aircraft shot down and seven damaged by explosive bullets.){{sfn|Terraine|1997|p=318}} The Italian 10th Army lost at least {{nowrap|5,500 men}} killed, about {{nowrap|10,000 wounded,}} {{nowrap|133,298 men}} taken prisoner and losses of {{nowrap|420 tanks}} and {{nowrap|845 guns.}}{{sfn|Harding|1941|nopp=y}}

===Subsequent operations===

{{main|Battle of Greece}}

A week after the Italian surrender at Beda Fomm, the Defence Committee in London ordered Cyrenaica to be held with the minimum of forces and the surplus sent to Greece. In the WDF (now [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]]), the 6th Australian Division was fully equipped and had few losses to replace. The 7th Armoured Division had been operating for eight months, wearing out its mechanical equipment and was withdrawn to refit. Two regiments of the [[2nd Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|2nd Armoured Division]] with the WDF were also worn out, leaving the division with only four tank regiments. The 6th Australian Division went to Greece in March, with a brigade group of the 2nd Armoured Division containing the best equipment. The remainder of the division and the new 9th Australian Division, minus two brigades and most of its transport sent to Greece, were replaced by two under-equipped brigades of the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Australian Division]]. The division took over in Cyrenaica, on the assumption that the Italians could not begin a counter-offensive until May, even with German reinforcements.{{sfn|Playfair|1956|pp=2–3}}

The 3rd Armoured Brigade of the 2nd Armoured Division was left in Cyrenaica comprising an under-strength light tank regiment, a second regiment using captured Italian tanks and from mid-March a cruiser tank regiment, also equipped with worn-out tanks. The 2nd Support Group had only one motor battalion, a field artillery regiment, one anti-tank battery and a machine-gun company; most of the divisional transport had been sent to Greece.{{sfn|Playfair|1956|pp=2–3}} A few thousand men of the 10th Army escaped the disaster in Cyrenaica but the [[Fifth Army (Italy)|5th Army]] in Tripolitania had four divisions. The Sirte, Tmed Hassan and Buerat strongholds were reinforced from Italy, which brought the Italian armies up to about {{nowrap|150,000 men.}} German reinforcements were sent to Libya to form a blocking detachment ({{lang|de|Sperrverband}}) under [[List of Adolf Hitler's directives|Directive 22]] (11 January), these being the first units of the {{lang|de|[[Afrika Korps]]}} ({{lang|de|Generalleutnant}} [[Erwin Rommel]]). On 25 March 1941, Graziani was replaced by Gariboldi.{{sfn|Playfair|1957|pp=359–362}}
