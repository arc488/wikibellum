'''Operation Tiderace''' was the codename of the British plan to retake [[Singapore]] following the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender in 1945]].&lt;ref&gt;Park, p. 2156, para 360.&lt;/ref&gt; The liberation force was led by [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]], [[Supreme Allied Commander]] of [[South East Asia Command]]. Tiderace was initiated in coordination with [[Operation Zipper]], which involved the liberation of Malaya.

==Background==
With the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] and an American planned [[Operation Downfall|invasion of Japan]], South East Asia Command were also drawing up plans to invade Malaya, codenamed [[Operation Zipper]]. With over 100,000 Allied infantry,&lt;ref&gt;Park, p. 2155, para 349.&lt;/ref&gt; the plan was to capture [[Port Klang|Port Swettenham]] and [[Port Dickson]], and would involve an airstrike of more than 500 aircraft of the [[Royal Air Force]]. The assault was scheduled for 9 September 1945, but was forestalled following the Surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Park, p. 2155, para 351.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the lodgement was secure, the Allies would have initiated [[Operation Mailfist]], during which ground forces were to advance south through Malaya and liberate Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Chant (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; It was expected that Operation Mailfist would begin in December 1945 and conclude in March 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Tiderace was planned soon after the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] on Aug 6 and 9. Emergency planning was put in preparation for the rapid occupation of Singapore at an early date should Japan agree to accept the terms of the [[Potsdam Declaration]] of 26 July.&lt;ref&gt;Park, pp. 2155–2156, para 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Operation Zipper was executed ahead of schedule, it did so on a much smaller scale, having quickly transferred a proportion of its original strength to Operation Tiderace. The convoy consisted of about 90 ships,&lt;ref name="H.M.S. Attacker"&gt;{{citation | title = H.M.S. Attacker| url = http://www.royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk/ESCORT/ATTACKER.htm| publisher = royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included two battleships, {{HMS|Nelson|28|6}} and the [[French battleship Richelieu|French battleship ''Richelieu'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-06CL-Cleopatra.htm|title=H.M.S. Cleopatra|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy cruiser [[HMS Sussex (96)|HMS ''Sussex'']] served as the flagship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-06CA-Sussex.htm|title=H.M.S. Sussex|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HMAS Hawkesbury (K363)|HMAS ''Hawkesbury'']] was the sole Australian warship during the Japanese surrender, escorting the repatriation transport [[MV Duntroon|''Duntroon'']].&lt;ref name="HMAS Hawkesbury"&gt;{{citation | title = HMAS ''Hawkesbury'' (I) |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-hawkesbury-i |publisher=Royal Australian Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller British naval force was given the task of liberating [[Penang]] under [[Operation Jurist]], a component of the overall [[Operation Zipper]].

There were a total of seven [[escort carrier]]s: {{HMS|Ameer|D01|6}}, [[HMS Attacker (D02)|HMS ''Attacker'']], {{HMS|Emperor|D98|6}}, [[HMS Empress (D42)|HMS ''Empress'']], [[HMS Hunter (D80)|HMS ''Hunter'']], [[HMS Khedive (D62)|HMS ''Khedive'']] and [[HMS Stalker (D91)|HMS ''Stalker'']].&lt;ref name="H.M.S. Hunter"&gt;{{citation | title = H.M.S. ''Hunter''| url = http://www.royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk/ESCORT/HUNTER.htm| publisher = royalnavyresearcharchive.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese naval fleet in Singapore consisted of the [[Japanese destroyer Kamikaze (1922)|destroyer ''Kamikaze'']]&lt;ref name="IJN Kamikaze: Tabular Record of Movement"&gt;{{citation|title = IJN Kamikaze: Tabular Record of Movement|url = http://www.combinedfleet.com/kamika_t.htm|publisher = Long Lancers|accessdate = 12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two cruisers, [[Japanese cruiser Myōkō|''Myōkō'']] and [[Japanese cruiser Takao (1930)|''Takao'']], both of which had been so badly damaged before that they were being used as floating anti-aircraft batteries. Two ex-German U-boats, [[German submarine U-181|''I-501'']] and [[German submarine U-862|''I-502'']] were also in Singapore.&lt;ref name="HIJMS Submarine I-501: Tabular Record of Movement"&gt;{{citation | title = HIJMS Submarine I-501: Tabular Record of Movement| url = http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-501.htm| publisher = Bob Hackett &amp; Sander Kingsepp| accessdate = 9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were moored at [[Singapore Naval Base]].&lt;ref name="HIJMS Submarine I-502: Tabular Record of Movement"&gt;{{citation | title = HIJMS Submarine I-502: Tabular Record of Movement| url = http://www.combinedfleet.com/I-502.htm| publisher = Bob Hackett &amp; Sander Kingsepp | accessdate = 9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Air strength in both Malaya and [[Sumatra]] was estimated to be a little more than 170 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Park, p. 2156, para 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to Singapore==
[[File:Official surrender Singapore.jpg|thumb|left|Admiral Lord [[Louis Mountbatten]] signs the acceptance of surrender for [[Great Britain]]. Brigadier (later Gen.) [[Kodandera Subayya Thimayya|Thimayya]] (future Chief of Staff of the Indian Army) is visible on the far left of the Allied table representing Indian forces. 12 September 1945]]

Operation Tiderace commenced when Mountbatten ordered Allied troops to set sail from [[Trincomalee]] and [[Rangoon]] on 31 August for Singapore. The fleet was not armed with offensive weapons as Mountbatten had good reason to believe that the Japanese in Malaya and Singapore would surrender without a fight: on 20 August General [[Itagaki Seishiro]], the commander in Singapore, had signalled Mountbatten that he would abide by his emperor's decision and was ready to receive instructions for the Japanese surrender of Singapore.&lt;ref name="The real Japanese surrender"/&gt;

Japan's defeat had caught the Japanese Command in Singapore by surprise. Many were unwilling to surrender and had vowed to fight to the death. Itagaki had initially balked at the order to surrender and instead ordered the 25th Army (the component of the 7th Area Army defending Singapore) to resist when the Allies arrived.&lt;ref name="The real Japanese surrender"/&gt; There was even a secret plan to massacre all Allied [[POW|PoW]]s on the island.&lt;ref name="The real Japanese surrender"/&gt; However, three days after the [[Surrender of Japan|Emperor's announcement]] on 15 August, Itagaki flew from Singapore to [[Saigon]] to confer with his leader Field Marshal Count [[Hisaichi Terauchi|Terauchi]], Commander of the Japanese Southern Army and all forces in South-east Asia. Terauchi prevailed over Itagaki who then sent his signal to Mountbatten. Newspapers in Singapore were finally allowed to carry the text of the Emperor's speech, confirming what many already knew from listening to [[All India Radio]] broadcasts from [[Delhi]] on forbidden shortwave radios.&lt;ref name="The real Japanese surrender"/&gt;

The Allies arrived in Malaya on 28 August, with a small portion of the fleet sent to recapture [[Penang]] as part of [[Operation Jurist]]. On 30 August 1945 a flight of 9 [[Consolidated PBY Catalina in Royal Australian Air Force Service|RAAF Catalinas]] landed in Singapore bearing medical supplies and personnel documents in preparation for the Japanese surrender and the liberation of the thousands of PoWs on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Agency, Digital Transformation.

She eventually limped into Singapore at 12:00 on 11 September.&lt;ref&gt;Sarnet &amp; Le Vaillant, pp. 331–334&lt;/ref&gt;

General Itagaki, accompanied by Vice Admiral Shigeru Fukudome and his aides, were brought aboard HMS ''Sussex'' in [[Keppel Harbour]] to discuss the surrender. They were received by Lieutenant-General Sir [[Philip Christison]] and Major-General [[Robert Mansergh]]. A tense encounter began when a Japanese officer reportedly remarked, "You are two hours late," only to be met with the reply, "We don't keep Tokyo time here."&lt;ref name="Forgotten wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia"/&gt; By 18:00, the Japanese had surrendered their forces on the island. An estimated 77,000 Japanese troops from Singapore were captured, plus another 26,000 from Malaya.&lt;ref name="The real Japanese surrender"/&gt;

The formal surrender was finalised on 12 September at [[Singapore City Hall]].&lt;ref name="The real Japanese surrender"/&gt; Lord Louis Mountbatten, [[Supreme Allied Commander]] of Southeast Asia Command, came to Singapore to receive the formal surrender of Japanese forces in South East Asia from General Itagaki on behalf of Field Marshal [[Hisaichi Terauchi]], commander of the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group|Japanese Southern Army Group]] who had suffered a stroke earlier in the year.&lt;ref name="Forgotten wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia"/&gt; A [[British Military Administration (Malaya)|British Military Administration]] was formed to govern the island until March 1946. Itagaki departed for Japan shortly afterwards to face trial and execution as a war criminal.&lt;ref name="Forgotten wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia"&gt;{{citation | title = Forgotten wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0M4Pl_VCExgC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49&amp;dq=japanese+rear+admiral+surrender+penang&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ug9mL1GMcL&amp;sig=ag8d21HvKtMQ_c9O2syTJn95mKc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sE4dS_mQHJLm7AOLqrzMDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=japanese%20rear%20admiral%20surrender%20penang&amp;f=false| publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japanese reaction to the surrender==
Itagaki had met his generals and senior staff at his HQ at the former [[Raffles College]] in [[Bukit Timah]] and told his men that they would have to obey the surrender instructions and keep the peace. That night, more than 300 officers and men killed themselves by falling onto their swords in the [[Raffles Hotel]] after a farewell [[sake]] party, and later, an entire Japanese platoon killed themselves using grenades.&lt;ref name="The real Japanese surrender"/&gt;

About 200 Japanese soldiers decided to join the communist guerrillas whom they were fighting just days before in a bid to continue the fight against the British. But they soon returned to their units when they found out that the [[MPAJA]], which was funded by the [[Malayan Communist Party]], did not plan to fight the returning British.&lt;ref name="The real Japanese surrender"/&gt;

Nonetheless, some stayed hidden in the jungles with the communists, and when [[Chin Peng]] and remnants of the Malayan Communist Party [[Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968–89)|ended their struggle in 1989]], two [[Japanese holdout|former Japanese soldiers]] emerged from the jungle with the communists and surrendered.&lt;ref name="The real Japanese surrender"/&gt;
