The '''Lower Silesian Offensive''' ({{lang-ru|Нижне-Силезская наступательная операция}}) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] offensive on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] of World War II in 1945, involving forces of the [[1st Ukrainian Front]] under Marshal [[Ivan Konev]]. It cleared German troops from much of [[Lower Silesia]] and [[Siege of Breslau|besieged]] a large German force in the provincial capital, [[Wrocław|Breslau]]. The offensive began on February 8 and continued until February 24, when the Soviets ceased their offensive having captured a small bridgehead across the [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]] River near [[Forst (Lausitz)|Forst]]. The offensive directly succeeded the [[Vistula–Oder Offensive]], in which Konev's troops had driven the German [[Army Group A]] from [[Poland]], liberating [[Kraków]] and taking bridgeheads over the [[Oder]] River.

==The offensive==
[[File:Pomerania and Silesia.jpg|thumb|Pomeranian and Silesian offensives]]
Konev intended to break out of the [[Ścinawa|Steinau]] and [[Oława|Ohlau]] bridgeheads, which had been secured at the end of the [[Vistula–Oder Offensive]], on February 8. He preceded the initial attack with a fifty-minute artillery bombardment, his troops crossing the start lines at 06:00.&lt;ref name=duffyp132&gt;Duffy, p.132&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the day the Front's spearheads had penetrated some 60&amp;nbsp;km. The 3rd Guards Tank Army was ordered to wheel southwards and then eastwards in order to encircle the city of [[Wrocław|Breslau]] from the rear, while the 4th Tank Army continued its push westwards from the Steinau bridgehead.

By February 15, forces from the two bridgeheads had surrounded Breslau while 3rd Guards Tank Army had closed the gap to the west, only elements of the German [[269th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|269th Infantry Division]] managing to withdraw. Another 35,000 troops and 80,000 civilians had been blockaded in Breslau.&lt;ref name=duffyp.34&gt;Duffy, p.134&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[Siege of Breslau]] lasted until the very end of the war.

The 4th Tank Army, in the meantime, had pushed far ahead towards the [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]] River, against some resistance from Fourth Panzer Army. On February 14, two German corps (the [[Panzer-Grenadier-Division Großdeutschland|Großdeutschland]] and [[XXIV Panzer Corps]]) mounted a sudden counter-attack that left Lelyushenko's force in a desperate fight to avoid encirclement.&lt;ref name=duffyp135&gt;Duffy, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans were unable to close the encirclement, and ceased attacking operations within five days, when the 52nd Army and 3rd Guards Tank Army were able to secure the flanks of Lelyushenko's position.

On February 24, faced with heavy German reinforcement, Konev closed the offensive phase of operations, having secured a small bridgehead across the Neisse near [[Forst (Lausitz)|Forst]]. This effectively defined the start lines in that sector for the [[Battle of Berlin]], or Berlin Offensive, two months later.

==Aftermath==
Schoerner attempted to win back some territory during March with successful counter-attacks at [[Lubań|Lauban]] and [[Strzegom|Striegau]]. An offensive to relieve Breslau was however disrupted by an offensive on the 1st Ukrainian Front's right flank to the south-east: the [[Upper Silesian Offensive]].
