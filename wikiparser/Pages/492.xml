After a long campaign of [[Leapfrogging (military)|island hopping]], the Allies were planning to use [[Kadena Air Base]] on the large island of Okinawa as a base for [[Operation Downfall]], the planned invasion of the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese home islands]], {{convert|340|mi|km|abbr=on}} away.

The United States created the [[Tenth United States Army|Tenth Army]], a cross-branch force consisting of the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th]], [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th]], [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th]], and [[96th Infantry Division (United States)|96th]] infantry divisions of the [[United States Army|US Army]] with the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st]], [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd]], and [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th]] divisions of the Marine Corps, to fight on the island. The Tenth was unique in that it had its own [[Tactical Air Force, Tenth Army|Tactical Air Force]] (joint Army-Marine command), and was also supported by combined naval and amphibious forces.&lt;!--What about the forces on the Japanese side?--&gt;

The battle has been referred to as the "typhoon of steel" in English, and ''tetsu no ame'' ("rain of steel") or ''tetsu no bōfū'' ("violent wind of steel") in Japanese.&lt;ref name="VeteransRH/R"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanveteranscenter.org/magazine/wwiichronicles/wwii-chronicles-issue-xxxix/okinawa-the-typhoon-of-steel/ |title=Okinawa: The Typhoon of Steel |publisher=American Veterans Center |date=April 1, 1945 |accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anniversaryRH&gt;[http://www.stripes.com/news/at-60th-anniversary-battle-of-okinawa-survivors-recall-typhoon-of-steel-1.31175 At 60th anniversary, Battle of Okinawa survivors recall 'Typhoon of Steel' – News – Stripes], Allen, David; Stars and Stripes; April 1, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BattleRH&gt;{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/okinawa-battle.htm |title=Battle of Okinawa |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nicknames refer to the ferocity of the fighting, the intensity of Japanese [[Kamikaze#Final phase|''kamikaze'' attacks]], and the sheer numbers of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] ships and armored vehicles that assaulted the island. The battle was one of the bloodiest in the Pacific, with approximately 160,000 casualties on both sides: at least 75,000 Allied and 84,166–117,000 Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.webharvest.gov/peth04/20041016045157/http://www.cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Huber/Huber.asp#118|title=Japan's battle of Okinawa, April-June 1945|last=Huber|first=Thomas|date=May 1990|website=Combined Arms Research Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/websites/www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/okinawa/chapter18.htm#b4|title=Chapter XVIII: The Battle Ends|website=permanent.access.gpo.gov|access-date=2020-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; including drafted [[Ryukyuan people|Okinawans]] wearing Japanese uniforms.&lt;ref name=mcg/&gt;&lt;ref name="heiwa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pref.okinawa.jp/site/kodomo/heiwadanjo/heiwa/7812.html |title=The Cornerstone of Peace: Number of Names Inscribed |publisher=Okinawa Prefecture |accessdate=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 149,425 Okinawans were killed, died by suicide or went missing, a significant proportion of the estimated pre-war 300,000 local population.&lt;ref name="heiwa" /&gt;

In the naval operations surrounding the battle, both sides lost considerable numbers of ships and aircraft, including the Japanese [[battleship]] {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}}. After the battle, Okinawa provided a fleet anchorage, troop staging areas, and airfields in proximity to Japan in preparation for a planned invasion.

[[File:Battle of Okinawa.svg|thumb|left|A map of US operations at Okinawa]]
In all, the US Army had over 103,000 soldiers (of these, 38,000+ were non-divisional artillery, combat support and HQ troops, with another 9,000 service troops),&lt;ref name="Rottman 2002 39"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rottman|first=Gordon|year=2002|title=Okinawa 1945: The Last Battle|url=https://archive.org/details/okinawalastbattl00rott|url-access=limited|publisher= Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-84176-546-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/okinawalastbattl00rott/page/n47 39]}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 88,000 Marines and 18,000 Navy personnel (mostly [[Seabees]] and medical personnel).&lt;ref name="Rottman 2002 40"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rottman|first=Gordon|year=2002|title=Okinawa 1945: The Last Battle|url=https://archive.org/details/okinawalastbattl00rott|url-access=limited|publisher= Osprey Publishing|isbn=1-84176-546-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/okinawalastbattl00rott/page/n48 40]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the Battle of Okinawa, the US 10th Army had 182,821 personnel under its command.&lt;ref name="Rottman 2002 40"/&gt; It was planned that General Buckner would report to Turner until the amphibious phase was completed, after which he would report directly to Spruance.
Although Allied land forces were entirely composed of American units, the [[British Pacific Fleet]] (BPF; known to the US Navy as Task Force 57) provided about ¼ of Allied naval air power (450 planes). It comprised a force which included 50 warships, of which 17 were aircraft carriers; while the British [[armoured flight deck|armored flight decks]] meant that fewer planes could be carried in a single aircraft carrier, they were more resistant to ''kamikaze'' strikes.&lt;ref name="HobbsUNI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hobbs|first1=David|title=The Royal Navy's Pacific Strike Force|url=https://www.usni.org/magazines/navalhistory/2013-01/royal-navys-pacific-strike-force|website=US Naval Institute|date=January 2013|accessdate=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although all the BPF aircraft carriers were provided by Britain, the carrier group was a combined [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] fleet with [[Royal Australian Navy|Australian]], [[Royal New Zealand Navy|New Zealand]] and [[Royal Canadian Navy|Canadian]] ships and personnel.&lt;ref name="HobbsUNI"/&gt; Their mission was to neutralize Japanese [[Military airbase|airfields]] in the [[Sakishima Islands]] and provide air cover against Japanese ''kamikaze'' attacks. Most of the air-to-air [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] and the small [[dive bomber]]s and [[Ground-attack aircraft|strike aircraft]] were US Navy [[Aircraft carrier|carrier-based]] airplanes.

===Japanese===
[[File:Japanese Commanders on Okinawa.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese commanders of Okinawa (photographed early in February 1945). In center: (1) Admiral Minoru Ota, (2) Lt. Gen. Mitsuru Ushijima, (3) Lt. Gen. Isamu Cho, (4) Col. Hitoshi Kanayama, (5) Col. Kikuji Hongo, and (6) Col. Hiromichi Yahara]]

The Japanese land [[Military campaign|campaign]] (mainly [[defense (military)|defensive]]) was conducted by the 67,000-strong (77,000 according to some sources) [[regular army|regular]] [[Thirty-Second Army (Japan)|32nd Army]] and some 9,000 [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) troops at Oroku Naval Base (only a few hundred of whom had been trained and equipped for ground combat), supported by 39,000 [[Conscription|drafted]] local [[Ryukyuan people]] (including 24,000 hastily drafted [[Rear (military)|rear]] [[militia]] called ''[[Boeitai]]'' and 15,000 non-uniformed laborers). The Japanese had used ''[[kamikaze]]'' tactics since the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], but for the first time, they became a major part of the defense. Between the American landing on April 1 and May 25, seven major ''kamikaze'' attacks were attempted, involving more than 1,500 planes.

The 32nd Army initially consisted of the [[9th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|9th]], [[24th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|24th]], and [[62nd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|62nd]] Divisions, and the 44th Independent Mixed Brigade. The 9th Division was moved to [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] before the [[invasion]], resulting in shuffling of Japanese defensive plans. Primary resistance was to be led in the south by Lieutenant General [[Mitsuru Ushijima]], his [[chief of staff]], Lieutenant General [[Isamu Chō]] and his chief of operations, Colonel [[Hiromichi Yahara]]. Yahara advocated a defensive [[Military strategy|strategy]], whilst Chō advocated an [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] one.

In the north, Colonel Takehido Udo was in command. The IJN troops were led by [[Rear Admiral]] [[Minoru Ōta]]. They expected the Americans to land 6–10 [[division (military)|divisions]] against the Japanese garrison of two and a half divisions. The staff calculated that superior quality and numbers of weapons gave each US division five or six times the [[firepower]] of a Japanese division. To this, would be added the Americans' abundant naval and air firepower.

[[File:Childsoldier In Okinawa.jpg|thumb|upright|Tekketsu Kinnōtai child soldiers on Okinawa]]
On Okinawa, middle school boys were organized into [[front line|front-line]]-service ''Tekketsu Kinnōtai'', while [[Himeyuri students]] were organized into a [[nurse|nursing]] unit.&lt;ref name=command&gt;Huber, Thomas M.{{cite web|url=http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Huber/Huber.asp |title=Japan's Battle of Okinawa, March–June 1945 |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214183638/http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Huber/Huber.asp |archivedate=February 14, 2009 }}, [[Command and General Staff College]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] mobilized 1,780 middle school boys aged 14–17 years into front-line-service. They were named ''Tekketsu Kinnōtai'' ([[:ja:鉄血勤皇隊]], "Iron and Blood Imperial Corps"). This mobilization was conducted by an ordinance of the Ministry of the Army, not by law. The ordinances mobilized the students as volunteer soldiers for form's sake; in reality, the military authorities ordered schools to force almost all students to "volunteer" as soldiers; sometimes they counterfeited the necessary documents. About half of the ''Tekketsu Kinnōtai'' were killed, including in suicide bomb attacks against tanks, and in guerrilla operations.

Between the 21 male and female secondary schools that made up these student corps, 2,000 students would die on the battlefield. Even with the female students acting mainly as nurses to Japanese soldiers they would still be exposed to the harsh conditions of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=[OFFICIAL] HIMEYURI PEACE MUSEUM |url=http://www.himeyuri.or.jp/EN/war.html#contents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After losing the Battle of Okinawa, the Japanese government enacted new laws in preparation for the decisive battles in the main islands. These laws made it possible for boys aged 15 or older and girls aged 17 or older to be drafted into [[front line|front-line]]-service.

The United States Navy's Task Force 58, deployed to the east of Okinawa with a picket group of from 6 to 8 destroyers, kept 13 carriers (7 CVs and 6 CVLs) on duty from March 23 to April 27 and a smaller number thereafter. Until April 27, a minimum of 14 and up to 18 escort carriers (CVEs) were in the area at all times. Until April 20, British Task Force 57, with 4 large and 6 escort carriers, remained off the Sakishima Islands to protect the southern flank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OKINAWA: THE LAST BATTLE, Chapter 4, Page 97 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/okinawa/chapter4.htm |accessdate=June 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protracted length of the campaign under stressful conditions forced Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] to take the unprecedented step of relieving the principal naval commanders to rest and recuperate. Following the practice of changing the fleet designation with the change of commanders, US naval forces began the campaign as the [[United States Fifth Fleet|US 5th Fleet]] under Admiral [[Raymond Spruance]], but ended it as the [[United States Third Fleet|3rd Fleet]] under Admiral [[William Halsey]].

Japanese air opposition had been relatively light during the first few days after the landings. However, on April 6, the expected air reaction began with an attack by 400 planes from [[Kyushu]]. Periodic heavy air attacks continued through April. During the period March 26&amp;nbsp;– April 30, twenty American ships were sunk and 157 damaged by enemy action. For their part, by April 30, the Japanese had lost more than 1,100 planes to Allied naval forces alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OKINAWA: THE LAST BATTLE, Chapter 4, Page 102|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/okinawa/chapter4.htm|accessdate=June 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 6 and June 22, the Japanese flew 1,465 ''kamikaze'' aircraft in large-scale attacks from Kyushu, 185 individual ''kamikaze'' sorties from Kyushu, and 250 individual ''kamikaze'' sorties from [[Formosa]]. While US intelligence estimated there were 89 planes on Formosa, the Japanese actually had about 700, dismantled or well camouflaged and dispersed into scattered villages and towns; the US [[Fifth Air Force]] disputed Navy claims of ''kamikaze'' coming from Formosa.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Hanson W.

The ships lost were smaller vessels, particularly the destroyers of the [[radar picket]]s, as well as [[destroyer escort]]s and landing ships. While no major Allied warships were lost, several fleet carriers were severely damaged. Land-based [[Shin'yō-class suicide motorboat]]s were also used in the Japanese [[suicide attack]]s, although Ushijima had disbanded the majority of the suicide boat battalions prior to the battle due to expected low effectiveness against a superior enemy. The boat crews were re-formed into three additional infantry battalions.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Chant, "The Encyclopedia of Codenames of World War II (Routledge Revivals)", p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Ten-Go===
[[File:Yamato battleship explosion.jpg|thumb|The super battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} explodes after persistent attacks from US aircraft.]]
[[Operation Ten-Go]] (''Ten-gō sakusen'') was the attempted attack by a strike force of 10 Japanese surface vessels, led by the {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamato||2}} and commanded by [[List of Imperial Japanese Navy admirals|Admiral]] [[Seiichi Itō]]. This small task force had been ordered to fight through enemy naval forces, then beach ''Yamato'' and fight from shore, using her guns as [[coastal artillery]] and her crew as [[naval infantry]]. The ''Ten-Go'' force was spotted by [[submarine]]s shortly after it left the Japanese home waters, and was intercepted by US carrier aircraft.

Under attack from more than 300 aircraft over a two-hour span, the world's largest battleship sank on April 7, 1945, after a one-sided battle, long before she could reach Okinawa. (US [[torpedo bomber]]s were instructed to aim for only one side to prevent effective counter flooding by the battleship's crew, and to aim for the bow or the stern, where armor was believed to be the thinnest.) Of ''Yamato''{{'}}s screening force, the [[light cruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Yahagi|1942|2}} and 4 of the 8 destroyers were also sunk. The Imperial Japanese Navy lost some 3,700 sailors, including Admiral Itō, at the cost of 10 US aircraft and 12 airmen.

===British Pacific Fleet===
[[File:HMS Formidable (67) on fire 1945.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Formidable|67|6}} on fire after a ''[[kamikaze]]'' attack on May 4. The ship was out of action for fifty minutes.]]
The [[British Pacific Fleet]], taking part as Task Force 57, was assigned the task of neutralizing the Japanese airfields in the Sakishima Islands, which it did successfully from March 26 to April 10.

On April 10, its attention was shifted to airfields on northern [[Taiwan (island)|Formosa]]. The force withdrew to [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]] on April 23.

On May 1, the British Pacific Fleet returned to action, subduing the airfields as before, this time with naval [[bombardment]] as well as aircraft. Several ''kamikaze'' attacks caused significant damage, but as the Royal Navy carriers had armoured [[flight deck]]s, they experienced only a brief interruption to their force's operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hastings|2007|p=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hobbs|2012|pp=175–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land battle took place over about 81 days beginning on April 1, 1945. The first Americans ashore were soldiers of the [[77th Sustainment Brigade|77th Infantry Division]], who landed in the [[Kerama Islands]], {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Okinawa on March 26. Subsidiary landings followed, and the Kerama group was secured over the next five days. In these preliminary operations, the 77th Infantry Division suffered 27 dead and 81 wounded, while Japanese dead and captured numbered over 650. The operation provided a protected anchorage for the fleet and eliminated the threat from suicide boats.

On March 31, Marines of the [[United States Marine Corps Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion|Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion]] landed without opposition on Keise Shima, four islets just {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of the Okinawan capital of [[Naha]]. A group of [[155 mm gun M1|{{convert|155|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} "Long Tom"]] artillery pieces went ashore on the islets to cover operations on Okinawa.

===Northern Okinawa===
[[File:Marines land on Okinawa shores.jpg|thumb|United States Marine Corps|[[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] reinforcements wade ashore to support the [[beachhead]] on Okinawa, April 1, 1945.]]

The main landing was made by the [[XXIV Corps (United States)|XXIV Corps]] and the [[III Amphibious Corps]] on the [[Hagushi]] beaches on the western coast of Okinawa on L-Day, April 1. The 2nd Marine Division conducted a [[demonstration (military)|demonstration]] off the Minatoga beaches on the southeastern coast to deceive the Japanese about American intentions and delay movement of [[Military reserve|reserves]] from there.

The [[6th Marine Division]] headed up the [[Ishikawa Isthmus]] and by April 7, had sealed off the [[Motobu Peninsula]].

Six days later on April 13, the 2nd Battalion, [[22nd Marine Regiment]], reached Hedo Point ([[Hedo-misaki]]) at the northernmost tip of the island. By this point, the bulk of the Japanese forces in the north (codenamed ''Udo Force'') were cornered on the Motobu Peninsula. Here, the terrain was mountainous and wooded, with the Japanese defenses concentrated on [[Yae-Dake]], a twisted mass of rocky ridges and ravines on the center of the peninsula. There was heavy fighting before the Marines finally cleared Yae-Dake on April 18. However, this was not the end of ground combat in northern Okinawa. On May 24, the Japanese mounted Operation Gi-gou: a company of ''[[Giretsu Kuteitai]]'' commandos were airlifted in a suicide attack on Yomitan. They destroyed {{convert|70000|USgal|l}} of fuel and nine planes before being killed by the defenders, who lost two men.

Meanwhile, the [[77th Infantry Division (United States)|77th Infantry Division]] assaulted Ie Island ([[Ie Shima]])—a small island off the western end of the peninsula—on April 16. In addition to conventional hazards, the 77th Infantry Division encountered ''kamikaze'' attacks, and even local women armed with spears. There was heavy fighting before the area was declared secured on April 21, and became another air base for operations against Japan.

While the 6th Marine Division cleared northern Okinawa, the US Army 96th and 7th Infantry Divisions wheeled south across the narrow waist of Okinawa. The 96th Infantry Division began to encounter fierce resistance in west-central Okinawa from Japanese troops holding fortified positions east of Highway No. 1 and about {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} northwest of Shuri, from what came to be known as [[Cactus Ridge]]. The 7th Infantry Division encountered similarly fierce Japanese opposition from a rocky pinnacle located about {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} southwest of Arakachi (later dubbed "[[The Pinnacle, Battle of Okinawa|The Pinnacle]]").&lt;!--Former edit specified that the 6th Marine Division was heading south after the XXIV corps was done clearing the north (wrong). 2nd Marine Division were not introduced until later in the campaign--&gt; By the night of April 8, American troops had cleared these and several other strongly fortified positions. They suffered over 1,500 battle casualties in the process, while killing or capturing about 4,500 Japanese. Yet the battle had only begun, for it was now realized that "these were merely outposts," guarding the Shuri Line.

The next American objective was [[Kakazu Ridge]], two hills with a connecting saddle that formed part of Shuri's outer defenses. The Japanese had prepared their positions well and fought tenaciously. The Japanese soldiers hid in fortified caves. American forces often lost personnel before clearing the Japanese out from each cave or other hiding place. The Japanese sent Okinawans at gunpoint out to obtain water and supplies for them, which led to civilian casualties. The American advance was inexorable, but resulted in a high number of casualties on both sides.

As the American assault against Kakazu Ridge stalled, Lieutenant General Ushijima – influenced by General Chō — decided to take the offensive. On the evening of April 12, the 32nd Army attacked American positions across the entire front. The Japanese attack was heavy, sustained, and well organized. After fierce [[close combat]], the attackers retreated, only to repeat their offensive the following night. A final assault on April 14 was again repulsed. The effort led the 32nd Army's staff to conclude that the Americans were vulnerable to night [[infiltration tactics]], but that their superior firepower made any offensive Japanese troop concentrations extremely dangerous, and they reverted to their defensive strategy.

The 27th Infantry Division—which had landed on April 9—took over on the right, along the west coast of Okinawa. General [[John R. Hodge]] now had three divisions in the line, with the 96th in the middle, and the 7th to the east, with each division holding a front of only about {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Hodge launched a new offensive of April 19 with a barrage of 324 guns, the largest ever in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Ocean Theater]]. Battleships, cruisers, and destroyers joined the bombardment, which was followed by 650 Navy and Marine planes attacking the enemy positions with [[napalm]], rockets, bombs, and machine guns. The Japanese defenses were sited on [[reverse slope defence|reverse slopes]], where the defenders waited out the artillery barrage and aerial attack in relative safety, emerging from the caves to rain [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] rounds and grenades upon the Americans advancing up the forward slope.

A tank assault to achieve [[breakthrough (military)|breakthrough]] by outflanking Kakazu Ridge failed to link up with its infantry support attempting to cross the ridge, and therefore failed with the loss of 22 tanks. Although [[flame tank]]s cleared many cave defenses, there was no breakthrough, and the XXIV Corps suffered 720 casualties. The losses might have been greater except for the fact that the Japanese had practically all of their infantry reserves tied up farther south, held there by another feint off the Minatoga beaches by the 2nd Marine Division that coincided with the attack.

At the end of April, after Army forces had pushed through the Machinato defensive line,&lt;ref&gt;West Point Atlas of American Wars&lt;/ref&gt; the 1st Marine Division relieved the 27th Infantry Division, and the 77th Infantry Division relieved the 96th. When the 6th Marine Division arrived, the III Amphibious Corps took over the right flank and the 10th Army assumed control of the battle.

[[File:OkinawaJapanesePOW.jpg|thumb|upright|A Japanese prisoner of war sits behind barbed wire after he and 306 others were captured within the last 24 hours of the battle by 6th Marine Division.]]

On May 4, the 32nd Army launched another [[counteroffensive]]. This time, Ushijima attempted to make [[amphibious warfare|amphibious assaults]] on the coasts behind American lines. To support his offensive, the Japanese artillery moved into the open. By doing so, they were able to fire 13,000 rounds in support, but effective American [[counter-battery fire]] destroyed dozens of Japanese artillery pieces. The attack failed.

Buckner launched another American attack on May 11. Ten days of fierce fighting followed. On May 13, troops of the 96th Infantry Division and [[763rd Tank Battalion (United States)|763rd Tank Battalion]] captured Conical Hill. Rising {{convert|476|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the Yonabaru coastal plain, this feature was the eastern anchor of the main Japanese defenses and was defended by about 1,000 Japanese. Meanwhile, on the opposite coast, the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions fought for "Sugar Loaf Hill". The capture of these two key positions exposed the Japanese around Shuri on both sides. Buckner hoped to envelop Shuri and trap the main Japanese defending force.

By the end of May, monsoon rains which had turned contested hills and roads into a morass exacerbated both the [[Military tactics|tactical]] and medical situations. The ground advance began to resemble a [[World War I]] battlefield, as troops became mired in mud, and flooded roads greatly inhibited evacuation of wounded to the rear. Troops lived on a field sodden by rain, part garbage dump and part graveyard. Unburied Japanese and American bodies decayed, sank in the mud, and became part of a noxious stew. Anyone sliding down the greasy slopes could easily find their pockets full of maggots at the end of the journey.&lt;ref name=gso&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/okinawa-battle.htm Battle of Okinawa], GlobalSecurity.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 29, Major General [[Pedro del Valle]], commander of the 1st Marine Division, ordered Captain Julian D. Dusenbury of&lt;ref name="valor.militarytimes.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=7742|title=Valor awards for Julian D. Dusenbury|website=valor.militarytimes.com|accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Company A, [[1st Battalion 5th Marines|1st Battalion]], [[5th Marine Regiment (United States)|5th Marines]], to capture [[Shuri Castle]]. Seizure of the castle represented both strategic and psychological blows for the Japanese and was a milestone in the campaign. Del Valle was awarded a [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal|Distinguished Service Medal]] for his leadership in the fight and the subsequent occupation and reorganization of Okinawa. Captain Dusenbury would later receive the Navy Cross for his actions.&lt;ref name="valor.militarytimes.com"/&gt;

Shuri Castle had been shelled by the battleship {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|6}} for three days before this advance.&lt;ref name="wonder-okinawa.jp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/001/002-e/004_03.html |title=The Ordeals of Shuri Castle |publisher=Wonder-okinawa.jp |date=August 15, 1945 |accessdate=April 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704145457/http://www.wonder-okinawa.jp/001/002-e/004_03.html |archivedate=July 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, the 32nd Army withdrew to the south and thus the Marines had an easy task of securing Shuri Castle.&lt;ref name="wonder-okinawa.jp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/extcontent/usmc/pcn-190-003135-00/sec5a.htm |title=The Final Campaign: Marines in the Victory on Okinawa (Assault on Shuri) |publisher=Nps.gov |accessdate=April 5, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415060912/http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/extcontent/usmc/pcn-190-003135-00/sec5a.htm |archivedate=April 15, 2010 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle, however, was outside the 1st Marine Division's assigned zone and only frantic efforts by the commander and staff of the 77th Infantry Division prevented an American [[airstrike]] and artillery bombardment which would have resulted in many casualties due to [[friendly fire]].

The Japanese retreat, although harassed by artillery fire, was conducted with great skill at night and aided by the monsoon storms. The 32nd Army was able to move nearly 30,000 personnel into its last defense line on the Kiyan Peninsula, which ultimately led to the greatest slaughter on Okinawa in the latter stages of the battle, including the deaths of thousands of civilians. In addition, there were 9,000 IJN troops supported by 1,100 militia, with approximately 4,000 holed up at the underground headquarters on the hillside overlooking the Okinawa Naval Base in the Oroku Peninsula, east of the airfield.

On June 4, elements of the 6th Marine Division launched an amphibious assault on the peninsula. The 4,000 Japanese sailors, including Admiral [[Minoru Ōta]], all committed suicide within the hand-built tunnels of the underground naval headquarters on June 13. By June 17, the remnants of Ushijima's shattered 32nd Army were pushed into a small pocket in the far south of the island to the southeast of [[Itoman]].

On June 18, General Buckner was killed by Japanese artillery fire while monitoring the progress of his troops from a forward observation post. Buckner was replaced by [[Roy Geiger]]. Upon assuming command, Geiger became the only US Marine to command a numbered army of the US Army in combat; he was relieved five days later by [[Joseph Stilwell]]. On June 19, General [[Claudius Miller Easley]], the commander of the US Army's 96th Infantry Division, was killed by Japanese machine gun fire, also while checking on the progress of his troops at the front.

The last remnants of Japanese resistance ended on June 21, although some Japanese continued hiding, including the future governor of [[Okinawa Prefecture]], [[Masahide Ōta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanfocus.org/-Norimatsu-Satoko/3415 |title="The World is beginning to know Okinawa": Ota Masahide reflects on his life from the Battle of Okinawa to the Struggle for Okinawa |publisher=Japanfocus.org |accessdate=May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ushijima and Chō committed suicide by ''[[seppuku]]'' in their command headquarters on Hill 89 in the closing hours of the battle. Colonel Yahara had asked Ushijima for permission to commit suicide, but the general refused his request, saying: "If you die there will be no one left who knows the truth about the battle of Okinawa. Bear the temporary shame but endure it. This is an order from your army Commander."&lt;ref&gt;John Toland, ''The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936–1945'', p. 723.&lt;/ref&gt; Yahara was the most senior officer to have survived the battle on the island, and he later authored a book titled ''The Battle for Okinawa''. On August 15, 1945, Admiral [[Matome Ugaki]] was killed while part of a kamikaze raid on Iheyajima island. The official surrender ceremony was held on September 7, near [[Kadena Air Base|Kadena airfield]].

===Military losses===

====American====
[[File:Attack on bloody ridge.jpg|thumb|Two US [[M4 Sherman]] tanks knocked out by Japanese artillery at Bloody Ridge, April 20, 1945]]

The Americans suffered over 75,000 - 82,000 casualties, including non-battle casualties (psychiatric, injuries, illnesses), of whom over 20,195 were dead (12,500 were killed in action, 7,700 died of wounded or non-combat deaths). Killed in action were 4,907 Navy, 4,675 Army, and 2,938 Marine Corps personnel.{{sfn|Frank|1999|p=71}} Several thousand personnel who died indirectly (from wounds and other causes) at a later date are not included in the total.

The most famous American casualty was Lieutenant General Buckner, whose decision to attack the Japanese defenses head-on, although extremely costly in American lives, was ultimately successful. Four days from the closing of the campaign, Buckner was killed by Japanese artillery fire, which blew lethal slivers of coral into his body, while inspecting his troops at the front line. He was the highest-ranking US officer to be killed by enemy fire during the [[Second World War]]. The day after Buckner was killed, Brigadier General Easley was killed by Japanese machine gun fire. The famous war correspondent [[Ernie Pyle]] was also killed by Japanese machine gun fire on Ie Island (Ie Shima, a small island just off of northwestern Okinawa).&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Chip.

Aircraft losses over the three-month period were 768 US planes, including those bombing the Kyushu airfields launching ''kamikaze''s. Combat losses were 458, and the other 310 were operational accidents. At sea, 368 Allied ships—including 120 amphibious craft—were damaged while another 36—including 15 amphibious ships and 12 destroyers—were sunk during the Okinawa campaign. The US Navy's dead exceeded its wounded, with 4,907 killed and 4,874 wounded, primarily from ''kamikaze'' attacks.&lt;ref name=ACtC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ACTC/actc-24.html |title=The Amphibians Came to Conquer |publisher=Ibiblio.org |accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American personnel casualties included thousands of cases of mental breakdown. According to the account of the battle presented in ''[[Marine Corps Gazette]]'':

{{quote|text=More mental health issues arose from the Battle of Okinawa than any other battle in the Pacific during World War II. The constant bombardment from artillery and mortars coupled with the high casualty rates led to a great deal of personnel coming down with [[Combat stress reaction|combat fatigue]]. Additionally the rains caused mud that prevented tanks from moving and tracks from pulling out the dead, forcing Marines (who pride themselves on burying their dead in a proper and honorable manner) to leave their comrades where they lay. This, coupled with thousands of bodies both friend and foe littering the entire island, created a scent you could nearly taste. [[Morale]] was dangerously low by the month of May and the state of discipline on a moral basis had a new low barometer for acceptable behavior. The ruthless atrocities by the Japanese throughout the war had already brought on an altered behavior (deemed so by traditional standards) by many Americans resulting in [[American mutilation of Japanese war dead|the desecration of Japanese remains]], but the Japanese tactic of using the Okinawan people as [[human shield]]s brought about a new aspect of terror and torment to the psychological capacity of the Americans.&lt;ref name=mcg&gt;{{cite web |author=SSgt Rudy R.

====Japanese losses====
The US military estimates that 110,071 Japanese soldiers were killed during the battle. This total includes conscripted Okinawan civilians.

A total of 7,401 Japanese regulars and 3,400 Okinawan conscripts surrendered or were captured during the battle. Additional Japanese and renegade Okinawans were captured or surrendered over the next few months, bringing the total to 16,346.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Appleman, Roy E.|author2=James M.

Many of the prisoners were native Okinawans who had been pressed into service shortly before the battle, and were less imbued with the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s no-surrender doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huber |first=Thomas M. |date=May 1990 |url=http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Huber/Huber.asp |title=Japan's Battle of Okinawa, April–June 1945 |work=Leavenworth Papers |publisher=[[United States Army]] Command and General Staff College |accessdate=May 9, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430232704/http://www-cgsc.army.mil/carl/resources/csi/Huber/Huber.asp |archivedate=April 30, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the American forces occupied the island, many Japanese soldiers put on Okinawan clothing to avoid capture, and some Okinawans would come to the Americans' aid by offering to identify these mainland Japanese.

The Japanese lost 16 combat vessels, including the super battleship ''Yamato''. Postwar examination of Japanese records revealed that Japanese aircraft losses at Okinawa were far below often-repeated US estimates for the campaign.&lt;ref name="Giangreco 2009 pg. 91"/&gt; The number of conventional and kamikaze aircraft actually lost or expended by the 3rd, 5th, and 10th Air Fleets, combined with about 500 lost or expended by the Imperial Army at Okinawa, was roughly 1,430.&lt;ref name="Giangreco 2009 pg. 91"/&gt; The Allies destroyed 27 Japanese tanks and 743 artillery pieces (including mortars, anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns), some of them eliminated by the naval and air bombardments but most knocked out by American counter-battery fire.

===Civilian losses, suicides, and atrocities===

Some of the other islands that saw major battles in World War II, such as [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]], were uninhabited or had been evacuated. Okinawa, by contrast, had a large [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] civilian population; US Army records from the planning phase of the operation make the assumption that Okinawa was home to about 300,000 civilians. According to various estimates, between a tenth and a third of them died during the battle,&lt;ref name=gso/&gt; or between 30,000 and 100,000 people. The official US Tenth Army count for the 82-day campaign is a total of 142,058 recovered enemy bodies (including those civilians [[Impressment|pressed into service]] by the Imperial Japanese Army), with the deduction made that about 42,000 were non-uniformed civilians who had been killed in the crossfire. Okinawa Prefecture's estimate is over 100,000 losses,&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;

During the battle, American forces found it difficult to distinguish civilians from soldiers. It became common for them to shoot at Okinawan houses, as one infantryman wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There was some return fire from a few of the houses, but the others were probably occupied by civilians – and we didn't care. It was a terrible thing not to distinguish between the enemy and women and children. Americans always had great compassion, especially for children. Now we fired indiscriminately.&lt;ref&gt;Feifer, George, ''The Battle of Okinawa'', The Lyons Press (2001), p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the impending Japanese defeat, civilians often committed [[mass suicide]], urged on by the Japanese soldiers who told locals that victorious American soldiers would go on a rampage of killing and raping. ''[[Ryūkyū Shimpō]]'', one of the two major Okinawan newspapers, wrote in 2007: "There are many Okinawans who have testified that the Japanese Army directed them to commit suicide.

====MEXT textbook controversy====
{{See also|Japanese history textbook controversies}}
There is ongoing disagreement between Okinawa's local government and Japan's national government over the role of the Japanese military in civilian mass suicides during the battle. In March 2007, the national [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT) advised textbook publishers to reword descriptions that the embattled Imperial Japanese Army forced civilians to kill themselves in the war to avoid being taken prisoner. MEXT preferred descriptions that just say that civilians received hand grenades from the Japanese military. This move sparked widespread protests among Okinawans. In June 2007, the [[Okinawa Prefectural Assembly]] adopted a resolution stating, "We strongly call on the (national) government to retract the instruction and to immediately restore the description in the textbooks so the truth of the Battle of Okinawa will be handed down correctly and a tragic war will never happen again."&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070623a1.html Okinawa slams history text rewrite], ''Japan Times'', June 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gheddo |first=Piero |url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Okinawa-against-Tokyo%E2%80%99s-attempts-to-rewrite-history-9666.html |title=JAPAN Okinawa against Tokyo's attempts to rewrite history – Asia News |publisher=Asianews.it |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2007, about 110,000 people held the biggest [[political rally]] in the history of Okinawa to demand that MEXT retract its order to textbook publishers regarding revising the account of the civilian suicides. The resolution stated, "It is an undeniable fact that the 'multiple suicides' would not have occurred without the involvement of the Japanese military and any deletion of or [[Historical revisionism|revision]] to (the descriptions) is a denial and distortion of the many testimonies by those people who survived the incidents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070930a2.html |title=110,000 protest history text revision order |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date=September 30, 2007 |accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007, MEXT partially admitted the role of the Japanese military in civilian mass suicides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/12/26/asia/japan.php Japan to amend textbook accounts of Okinawa suicides] ''[[International Herald Tribune|Herald Tribune]]'', December 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry's Textbook Authorization Council allowed the publishers to reinstate the reference that civilians "were forced into mass suicides by the Japanese military", on condition it is placed in sufficient context. The council report stated, "It can be said that from the viewpoint of the Okinawa residents, they were forced into the mass suicides."&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20071227a1.html Texts reinstate army's role in mass suicides: Okinawa prevails in history row] ''[[Japan Times]]'', December 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; That was not enough for the survivors who said it is important for children today to know what really happened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7098876.stm Okinawa's war time wounds reopened] BBC News, November 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nobel Prize-winning author [[Kenzaburō Ōe]] wrote a booklet which states that the mass suicide order was given by the military during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070912a3.html Witness: Military ordered mass suicides], ''Japan Times'', September 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He was sued by revisionists, including a wartime commander during the battle, who disputed this and wanted to stop publication of the booklet. At a court hearing, Ōe testified "Mass suicides were forced on Okinawa islanders under Japan's [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] social structure that ran through the state of Japan, the Japanese armed forces and local garrisons."&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20071110a3.html Oe testifies military behind Okinawa mass suicides] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112142909/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20071110a3.html |date=November 12, 2007}}, ''Japan Times'', November 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008, the [[Osaka Prefecture]] Court ruled in favor of Ōe, stating, "It can be said the military was deeply involved in the mass suicides." The court recognized the military's involvement in the mass suicides and [[murder-suicide]]s, citing the testimony about the distribution of grenades for suicide by soldiers and the fact that mass suicides were not recorded on islands where the military was not stationed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20080329a1.html Court sides with Oe over mass suicides], ''Japan Times'', March 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Korean-Japanese director Pak Su-nam announced her work on the documentary ''Nuchigafu'' (Okinawan for "only if one is alive") collecting living survivors' accounts to show "the truth of history to many people", alleging that "there were two types of orders for 'honorable deaths'—one for residents to kill each other and the other for the military to kill all residents".&lt;ref&gt;Nayoki Himeno, [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201205240011 Director humanizes tragedy of Okinawan mass suicides] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528075230/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201205240011 |date=May 28, 2013}}, ''The Asashi Shimbun'', May 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, Japanese textbook publisher Shimizu Shoin was permitted by MEXT to publish the statements that "Orders from Japanese soldiers led to Okinawans committing group suicide" and "The [Japanese] army caused many tragedies in Okinawa, killing local civilians and forcing them to commit mass suicide."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.today/20130413130816/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130327p2a00m0na014000c.html New high school texts say Japanese Imperial Army ordered WWII Okinawa suicides], ''The Mainichi'', March 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ninety percent of the buildings on the island were destroyed, along with countless historical documents, artifacts, and cultural treasures, and the tropical landscape was turned into "a vast field of mud, lead, decay and maggots".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyc-shorinryu.com/okinawa.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819073836/http://www.nyc-shorinryu.com/okinawa.html|url-status=dead|title=Okinawan History and Karate-do|archivedate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military value of Okinawa "exceeded all hope". Okinawa provided a fleet anchorage, troop staging areas, and airfields in proximity to Japan. The US cleared the surrounding waters of mines in [[Operation Zebra]], occupied Okinawa, and set up the [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands]], a form of military government, after the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Military Government in the Ryukyu Islands, 1945–1950| isbn=1410218791| last1=Fisch| first1=Arnold G.| date=December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, one official of the prefectural government told David Hearst of ''[[The Guardian]]'':

{{quote|text=You have the [[Battle of Britain]], in which your airmen protected the British people. We had the Battle of Okinawa, in which the exact opposite happened. The Japanese army not only starved the Okinawans but used them as human shields. That dark history is still present today&amp;nbsp;– and Japan and the US should study it before they decide what to do with next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Hearst in Okinawa |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/07/okinawa-japan-military-tension |title=Second battle of Okinawa looms as China's naval ambition grows  |work=The Guardian |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Effect on the wider war===
Because the next major event following the Battle of Okinawa was "the total surrender of Japan," the "effect" of this battle is more difficult to consider. Due to the surrender, the next anticipated series of battles – an invasion of the Japanese homeland – never occurred. (Therefore, all military strategies on both sides which presupposed this apparently-inevitable next development were immediately rendered moot.)

Some military historians believe that the Okinawa campaign led directly to the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], as a means of avoiding the [[Operation Downfall|planned ground invasion of the Japanese mainland]]. This view is explained by [[Victor Davis Hanson]] in his book ''Ripples of Battle'':

{{quote|text=...&amp;nbsp;because the Japanese on Okinawa&amp;nbsp;... were so fierce in their defense (even when cut off, and without supplies), and because casualties were so appalling, many American strategists looked for an alternative means to subdue mainland Japan, other than a direct invasion.
