The '''Battle of the Dukla Pass''', also known as the '''Dukla / Carpatho-Dukla / Rzeszów-Dukla / Dukla-Prešov Offensive''' was the battle for control over the [[Dukla Pass]] on the border between [[Poland]] and [[Slovakia]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] of [[World War II]] between [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in September–October 1944. It was part of the Soviet [[East Carpathian Strategic Offensive]] that also included the [[Carpathian-Uzhgorod Offensive]]. The operation's primary goal, to provide support for the Slovak [[rebellion]], was not achieved, but it concluded the full liberation of the [[Ukraine]] in its modern borders by the occupation of the [[Outer Subcarpathia|Subcarpathia]]n region as a territory of the former [[Carpatho-Ukraine]].

The German resistance in the eastern [[Carpathian]] region was much harder than expected. The battle which began on 8 September would not see the Soviet forces on the other side of the pass until 6 October, and German forces would stop their heavy resistance in the region only around 10 October. Five days to [[Prešov]] turned into fifty days to [[Svidník]] alone with over 70,000 casualties on both sides. Prešov that was to be reached in six days remained beyond the Czechoslovaks' grasp for four months.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Baumgarten, [http://lemko.org/rusyn/svoboda.html GENERAL LUDVIK SVOBODA: COMMANDER OF THE 1ST CZECHOSLOVAK ARMY CORPS]&lt;/ref&gt; The battle would be counted among the most bloody in the entire Eastern Front and the history of Slovakia;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c-rs.org/Chapters/NewEngl/07dukla.html BATTLE OF THE DUKLA PASS LECTURE]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the valleys in the pass near villages of [[Kapišová]], [[Chyrowa]], [[Iwla]] and [[Głojsce]] would become known as the ''Valley of Death''.&lt;ref name="friends"&gt;[http://www.dynamiclink.com/dukla/dukla_operation.htm THE CARPATHO-DUKLA OPERATION]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In summer 1944, [[Slovak National Uprising|Slovaks rebelled against the Nazis]] and the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] government appealed to Soviets for help. On 31 August, Soviet marshal [[Ivan Konev]] was ordered to prepare plans for an offensive to destroy Nazi forces in Slovakia. The plan was to push through the old Slovak-Polish border in the [[Carpathian Mountains]] via the [[Dukla Pass]] near Svidník to penetrate Slovakia proper.&lt;ref name="iabsi"&gt;[http://www.iabsi.com/gen/public/Military_dukla_pass.htm Battle for Dukla Pass]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, however, the Germans had fortified the region, forming the ''Karpatenfestung'' ("Carpathian fortress") or ''[[Árpád Line]]''.

==Battle==
The Soviet operation plan called for the Soviet forces to cross the pass and capture the town of Prešov within five days.&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;[http://www.reenactment-sk.szm.sk/Operations/Dukla.htm FACTS ABOUT CARPATHIAN – DUKLA´S OPERATION]&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation started on 8 September. It took the Soviets three days to take [[Krosno]] (it was captured on 11 September). One of the biggest battles in the past took place on and around Hill&amp;nbsp;534 in the northwest from the town of [[Dukla]]; the battle to capture this hill lasted from 10–20 September, and during that period the control of the hill changed more than 20 times.&lt;ref name="facts"/&gt; The town of Dukla was seized on 21 September.&lt;ref name="facts"/&gt; The area of the former Czechoslovak state border—heavily fortified by the Germans—was captured on 6 October; it took almost a month for the Soviet forces to reach Slovakia.&lt;ref name="facts"/&gt;

The [[Dukla]] operation did not end when the Soviets forced the pass. The combat zone shifted to Eastern Slovakia, with Soviet forces trying to outflank and push back the German forces, still strong and having many fortified positions. South of the pass and directly west of the village of [[Dobroslava]] lies an area that has come to be known as the "Valley of Death". Here Soviet and German armor clashed in a miniature reenactment of the great tank [[battle of Kursk]].&lt;ref name= "friends"/&gt; Soviet and Czechoslovak forces would enter Svidník on 28 October.&lt;ref name= "friends"/&gt; A major German fortified position near the pass, Hill 532 "Obšár", would be secured as late as on 25 November 1944.&lt;ref name="facts"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The [[Slovak National Uprising]] was mostly crushed by the time Soviet units secured Slovak territories; one of the main reasons for it was that the German resistance in the Dukla Pass was much heavier than expected. Another factor was that the Slovak insurgent forces failed to secure the other side of the pass, as planned by the Slovak and Soviet commanders during early preparations.&lt;ref name="iabsi"/&gt;

In 1949, the Czechoslovak government erected a memorial and cemetery southeast of the Dukla border crossing, in [[Vyšný Komárnik]], the first liberated village on the territory of (then) Czechoslovakia. It contains the graves of several hundred Soviet and Czechoslovak soldiers. Several other memorials and cemeteries have also been erected in the region.&lt;ref name="iabsi"/&gt;

In 1956, the [[Association football|football]] club [[Dukla Prague|ATK Praha]] changed their name to Dukla Praha (Dukla Prague) in honour of those who had fallen in the battle.
