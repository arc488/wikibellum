The '''Battle of the Denmark Strait''' was a naval engagement on 24 May 1941 in the [[Second World War]], between ships of the [[Royal Navy]] and the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''. The British [[battleship]] {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} and the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} fought the German [[battleship]] {{Ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{Ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, which were attempting to break out into the North Atlantic to attack Allied merchant shipping ([[Operation Rheinübung]]).

Less than 10 minutes after the British opened fire, a shell from ''Bismarck'' struck ''Hood'' near her aft ammunition magazines. Soon afterwards, ''Hood'' exploded and sank within three minutes, with the loss of all but three of her crew. ''Prince of Wales'' continued to exchange fire with ''Bismarck'' but suffered serious malfunctions in her main armament. The British battleship had only been completed in late March 1941, and used new quadruple gun turrets that were unreliable. ''Prince of Wales'' soon broke off the engagement.&lt;ref name="Barnett 2004, p. 295."/&gt;

The battle was considered a tactical victory for the Germans but its impact was short-lived. The damage done to ''Bismarck'''s forward fuel tanks forced the abandonment of the breakout and an attempt to escape to [[dry dock]] facilities in occupied France, producing an [[operational level of war|operational]] victory for the British.&lt;ref name="Barnett 2004, p. 295."/&gt; Incensed by the loss of ''Hood'', a large British force pursued ''Bismarck'' resulting in [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|her loss three days later]].

===German plans===
{{main|Operation Rheinübung}}

In April 1941, the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' intended to send the recently completed [[fast battleship]] {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} into the Atlantic Ocean to raid the [[convoy]]s carrying supplies from North America to Britain. The operation was intended to complement the [[U-boat]] attacks on British supply lines during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. The two fast battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} had just completed a similar operation, code-named [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Berlin]], between January and March that year. The number of major warships available to the Germans were limited; ''Bismarck''{{'}}s [[sister ship]] {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}} was not yet operational, ''Scharnhorst'' was in need of a [[water-tube boiler|boiler]] overhaul after Operation Berlin, and ''Gneisenau'' had been [[torpedo]]ed while in [[Brest, France]].&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin 1985, pp. 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the [[heavy cruiser]]s {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}} and {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, both under refit in Germany after their own raiding operations, was delayed by British air attacks that struck supply depots in [[Kiel]].&lt;ref&gt;Bercuson &amp; Herwig, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral [[Günther Lütjens]], the fleet commander who was to command German forces during the planned [[Operation Rheinübung]], sought to delay until repairs to ''Scharnhorst'' were completed or ''Tirpitz'' could join ''Bismarck'', but the ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' (Naval High Command) instructed Lütjens to begin the operation as soon as possible to keep pressure on Britain's supply lines.&lt;ref&gt;Boog, Rahn, Stumpf &amp; Wegner, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the only vessel available to support ''Bismarck'' was the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin 1985, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

===British plans===
The British [[Royal Navy]] learned of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s sortie after the Swedish cruiser {{HSwMS|Gotland|1933|2}} spotted the vessels passing through the western [[Baltic Sea]] on 20 May; ''Gotland''{{'}}s report was passed to the British [[naval attache]] in Stockholm, who forwarded it to the [[Admiralty]]. British reconnaissance aircraft confirmed the Germans' presence in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Bercuson &amp; Herwig, pp. 65, 68&lt;/ref&gt; Now aware that major German warships were at sea with the intention to break into the Atlantic, the Royal Navy began to despatch vessels to patrol the likely routes, including the heavy cruisers {{HMS|Norfolk|78|6}} and {{HMS|Suffolk|55|2}} to cover the [[Denmark Strait]] between Greenland and Iceland. Another group, consisting of the battleship ''Prince of Wales'', the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Hood|51|6}}, and a screen of six [[destroyer]]s,{{#tag:ref|The destroyers {{HMS|Electra|H27|2}}, {{HMS|Achates|H12|2}}, {{HMS|Antelope|H36|2}}, {{HMS|Anthony|H40|2}}, {{HMS|Echo|H23|2}} and {{HMS|Icarus|D03|2}}.|group=nb}} under the command of Vice-Admiral [[Lancelot Holland]] in ''Hood'', cruised to the south of Iceland to intercept the Germans once they were detected. ''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk'' spotted ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' on the evening of 23 May; ''Suffolk'' was fitted with [[radar]] that allowed them to shadow the Germans through the night whilst remaining outside of German gun range.

''Prince of Wales'' was a newly commissioned [[King George V-class battleship (1939)|''King George V''-class]] battleship, similar to ''Bismarck'' in size and power. ''Prince of Wales'' had not yet been properly "shaken down", and her crew was inexperienced. She still had mechanical problems, especially with her main armament. The ship had sailed with shipyard workers still aboard working on her. {{#tag:ref|When ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' first sighted her in the Denmark Strait, they identified her as ''King George V'', as they believed ''Prince of Wales'' could not yet have put to sea.|group=nb}}

For 20 years after her commissioning in 1920, ''Hood'' was the largest and heaviest warship in the world. Combining eight massive [[BL 15-inch Mk I naval gun]]s with a top speed greater than any [[battleship]] on the sea, ''Hood'' was the pride of Great Britain's navy, and embodied the world dominance of British naval power. Despite this, ''Hood'' had one conspicuous flaw as compared to the [[super-dreadnought]] battleships she served alongside: as a [[battlecruiser]], much of her bulk was dedicated to extra engine power instead of comprehensive armour coverage. This was in accordance with the prevailing theory originally propounded by [[First Sea Lord]] [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]] that "speed is armour".

While her 12-inch [[belt armour]] was considered sufficient against most [[capital ships]] she was likely to encounter, her 3 inches of deck armour was only rated against shell splinters, leaving her badly unprotected against [[plunging fire]] at long range. At the time of her commissioning in World War I, naval gunnery was severely inaccurate at the ranges necessary to produce plunging fire, and ''Hood's'' greater speed and maneuverability were seen as an acceptable trade-off. However, as the accuracy of naval gunfire increased in the inter-war period, ''Hood'' was eventually scheduled to receive an upgrade in 1939 that would have doubled her deck armour to 6 inches, but the outbreak of World War II meant the upgrade never took place. She thus sortied to war at a marked disadvantage against the new capital ships of the Axis.

Aware of ''Hood'''s inadequate protective armour, distant to the southeast of where the battle took place, Holland's superior (Admiral Sir [[John Tovey]]) deliberated on ordering him to have ''Prince of Wales'' sail ahead of ''Hood''. With the ships in this position, Tovey concluded the better-protected ''Prince of Wales'' could draw the German battleships' large-shell gunfire. Ultimately, Tovey did not give the order, later saying "I did not feel such interference with such a senior officer justified."&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1974, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
===Both plans go awry===
[[File:HOOD023.jpg|thumb|uptight|The last picture of ''Hood'' as a fighting unit. The four guns in the foreground are those of ''Prince of Wales'''s 'A' turret.]]
[[File:090101 PoW track chart.jpg|thumb|The original track chart of HMS ''Prince of Wales'' for the battle of the Denmark Strait, with manuscript additions]]

The ''Kriegsmarine'' had hoped that the ''Bismarck'' force would enter onto trans-Atlantic commerce raiding, from the Norwegian Sea via the Denmark Strait, undetected and unopposed. The Germans based this hope upon a transit from German territorial waters on the North Sea; and, through the territorial waters of German occupied countries (the Netherlands and Norway) into the Norwegian Sea, undetected by aerial searches; neutral ship encounters; and traditional "coast-watching" observations performed by formal and informal efforts of maritime intelligence gathering, in the neutral and occupied countries surrounding the North Sea.

In the event, the ground-level coast-watching observations from both neutral and occupied territories identified the principal combatant units sortied for the Exercise Rhine operation from the moment they left German territorial waters. The combatants (''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'') were identified by in-country coast-watchers located in the Netherlands; who were able to identify the ships and communicate with their clandestine contacts, the dates and times of the German surface units, moving in their designated coast-watch areas of responsibility.

The ships of neutral Sweden acknowledged the transit of the main combatants in the normal shipping lanes in the North Sea, and reported on them in their normal routine to their maritime authorities. Swedish territory as well hosted individual ground-level coast watchers who were able to follow and report on movements in Swedish coastal waters. These observations were passed directly to Royal Navy intelligence by routine maritime diplomatic channels maintained by the British naval attaché in Stockholm. Thus, when ''Bismarck'' and her escort moved into the unoccupied fjords of German occupied Norway, for final coastal refueling and topping off of ships' stores and supplies, the RAF (weather permitting) was able to keep a final watch on the location and timing of the German raider force. If the Germans were not aware of the specifics of the enemy's continuing intelligence coverage and surveillance, up to this point, they should have been generally aware of - and concluded - that the forces conducting the aerial surveillance had had the benefit of the prior surveillance and intelligence on the operation from its start.

Holland's battle plan was to have ''Hood'' and ''Prince of Wales'' engage ''Bismarck'' while ''Suffolk'' and ''Norfolk'' engaged ''Prinz Eugen'' (which, Holland assumed, still steamed behind ''Bismarck'' and not ahead of her). He signaled this to Captain [[John Leach (Royal Navy officer)|John C. Leach]] of ''Prince of Wales''&lt;ref&gt;Bercuson and Herwig 2001, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; but did not radio Wake-Walker, who as Commander of the 1st Cruiser Squadron directed ''Suffolk'' and ''Norfolk'', for fear of disclosing his location. Instead, he observed [[radio silence]]. Holland hoped to meet the enemy at approximately 02:00. Sunset in this latitude was at 01:51 (ship's clocks were four hours ahead of local time&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1974, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;). ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' would be silhouetted against the sun's afterglow while ''Hood'' and ''Prince of Wales'' could approach rapidly, unseen in the darkness, to a range close enough not to endanger ''Hood'' with plunging fire from ''Bismarck''.&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau 2002, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans would not expect an attack from this quarter, giving the British the advantage of surprise.

The plan's success depended on ''Suffolk''{{'}}s continually unbroken contact with the German ships. However, ''Suffolk'' lost contact from 00:28. For 90 minutes, Holland neither sighted the German ships nor received any further news from ''Norfolk'' or ''Suffolk''. Reluctantly, Holland ordered ''Hood'' and ''Prince of Wales'' to turn south-southwest but he detached his destroyers which continued searching to the north. However, the loss of contact should be understood as temporary and tactical only; and not strategic in terms of the tactical outcome. ''Suffolk'' lost contact with its reconnaissance target (the enemy fleet) in what was essentially a closed, confined rectangular space; aligned generally Northeast (the entrance to the Denmark Strait) to Southwest (the exit of the Strait into the Atlantic). The enemy units were firmly constrained by the Greenland ice pack to the North, and the extensive Royal Navy Minefield to the South along the coast of Iceland. Given the prior warning of the German sortie, there was ample time for the Royal Navy to place armed reconnaissance at both ends of this narrow alignment. ''Suffolk'' and ''Norfolk'' at the eastern entrance to the Strait (where contact was made immediately upon ''Bismarck''{{'}}s entry). And Holland was waiting at the western end as the ''Bismarck'' force exited the western end of the Strait.

Strategically, it was an unquestioned fact (including the approximate timing) that ''Bismarck''{{'}}s and ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s entrance into the Atlantic (the fundamental objective of Rhine Exercise), was known from the moment the fleet left German territorial waters. And that was a long enough time span before the fleet's final fitting out for transit to the Denmark Strait, that Lütjens could not have helped but to realize, that his force would not under any circumstance enter the Atlantic undetected nor would it enter unopposed. And by the time it was opposed, it would occur with forces that would likely ensure his fleet's ultimate destruction. And such destruction would take place before any supply convoy units (the whole purpose of the operation), were threatened by Operation Rhine Exercise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-21E-HMS_Electra.htm HMS Electra (H 27) -  E-class Destroyer] www.naval-history.net&lt;/ref&gt;

Before contact was re-established, the two squadrons missed each other narrowly. Had the German ships not altered course to the west at 01:41 to follow the line of the Greenland icepack, the British would have intercepted them much earlier than they did. The British destroyers were just {{convert|10|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} to the southeast when the Germans made this course change. If the visibility had not been reduced to {{convert|3|-|5|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}}, the German vessels would probably have been spotted (since generally on a calm, clear day ship lookouts can observe large objects and ships about 12 miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) distant on the horizon. And if the ship's lookouts are in a [[crow's nest]], the observable distance is even farther).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 2004, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before 03:00, ''Suffolk'' regained contact with ''Bismarck''. ''Hood'' and ''Prince of Wales'' were {{convert|35|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} away, slightly ahead of the Germans. Holland signalled to steer toward the Germans and increased speed to {{convert|28|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Suffolk''{{'}}s loss of contact had placed the British at a disadvantage. Instead of the swiftly closing head-on approach Holland had envisioned, he would have to converge at a wider angle, much more slowly. This would leave ''Hood'' vulnerable to ''Bismarck''{{'}}s plunging shells for a much longer period. The situation worsened further when, at 03:20, ''Suffolk'' reported that the Germans had made a further course alteration to the west, placing the German and British squadrons almost abeam of each other.

At 05:35, lookouts on ''Prince of Wales'' spotted the German ships {{convert|17|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} away. The Germans, already alerted to the British presence through their [[hydrophone|hydrophonic equipment]], picked up the smoke and masts of the British ships 10 minutes later. At this point, Holland had the option of joining ''Suffolk'' in shadowing ''Bismarck'' and waiting for Tovey to arrive with ''King George V'' and other ships to attack or to order his squadron into action. He chose the latter at 05:37.&lt;ref&gt;Boyne 1995, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The rough seas in the Strait kept the destroyers' role to a minimum and the cruisers ''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk'' would be too far behind the German force to reach the battle.

==Battle==
===Opening moves===
''Hood'' opened fire at 05:52 at a distance of approximately {{convert|26500|yd|m|abbr=on}}. Holland had ordered firing to begin on the leading ship, ''Prinz Eugen'', believing from her position that she was ''Bismarck''. Holland soon amended his order and directed both ships to engage the rear ship, ''Bismarck''. ''Prince of Wales'' had already identified and engaged ''Bismarck'', whereas ''Hood'' is believed to have continued to fire at ''Prinz Eugen'' for some time.

Holland was a gunnery expert; he was well aware of the danger posed by ''Hood''{{'}}s weak horizontal protection and wanted to reduce the range as quickly as possible. At a shorter range, the trajectory of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s shells would be flatter and they would be more likely to hit the sides of the ship or glance off the top deck, rather than penetrate ''Hood''{{'}}s thin deck armour. Holland closed the range at an angle that placed the German ships too far forward of the beam, which meant that only 10 of the 18 British heavy guns could train and presented the Germans with a bigger target than necessary. One of ''Prince of Wales''{{'}} forward guns became unserviceable after the first salvo, leaving only 9 still firing.&lt;ref name="Barnett 1991, p. 292."&gt;Barnett 1991, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Suffolk'' and ''Norfolk'' tried to engage ''Bismarck'' during the action but both were out of range and had an insufficient speed advantage over ''Bismarck'' to rapidly close the range.&lt;ref&gt;Bonomi, ''The Battle of the Denmark Strait''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Naval Staff History p8"&gt;Naval Staff History, ''German Capital Ships and Raiders in WW2, Battle Summary No. 5'', p8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Germans also had the [[weather gauge]], meaning that the British ships were steaming into the wind, spray drenching the lenses of ''Prince of Wales'' "A" turret's {{convert|42|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Barr and Stroud]] [[coincidence rangefinder]] and both British ships' "B" turret {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} rangefinders.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;"A" turret was the furthest forward turret with "B" behind and above it. At the rear "Y" was the furthest aft with "X" behind and above, if present - the ''Prince of Wales'' did not have an "X" turret&lt;/ref&gt; The shorter based ({{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}}) ones in the director towers had to be used instead. Holland had ''Prince of Wales'' stay close to ''Hood'', conforming to ''Hood''{{'}}s movements instead of varying course and speed, which made it easier for the Germans to find the range to both British ships. It would have aided Holland's gunners if they had both fired upon ''Bismarck'' as originally planned, since they could time precisely each other's salvos to avoid mistaking one ship's fire for the other. The British could also use ''Concentration Fire'', where both ships' main armament salvos would be controlled by one ship's fire control computer—probably ''Prince of Wales''{{'}} modern [[Admiralty Fire Control Table]].

''Prince of Wales'' struck her target first. She would ultimately hit ''Bismarck'' three times. One shell struck the commander's boat and put the seaplane catapult amidships out of action (the latter damage not being discovered until much later, during an attempt to fly off the ship's War Diary on the eve of her final battle). The second shell passed through the bow from one side to the other without exploding. The third struck the hull underwater and burst inside the ship, flooding a generator room and damaging the bulkhead to an adjoining boiler room, partially flooding it. The last two hits caused damage to ''Bismarck''{{'}}s machinery and medium flooding.&lt;ref name="[http://www.navweaps.com/index_inro/INRO_Bismarck_p1.htm Garzke and Dulin, Bismarck's Final Battle, part 1.]"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.navweaps.com/index_inro/INRO_Bismarck_p1.htm |title=Garzke and Dulin, Bismarck's Final Battle, part 1. |access-date=24 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207232216/http://www.navweaps.com/index_inro/INRO_Bismarck_p1.htm |archive-date=7 December 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hit also severed a steam line and wounded five of ''Bismarck'''s crew by scalding.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1974, p.116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dewar, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garzke &amp; Dulin 1985, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; The damage to the bow cut access to {{convert|1000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of fuel oil in the forward fuel tanks, caused ''Bismarck'' to leave an oil slick and reduced her speed by {{convert|2|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Bismarck'' was soon listing 9° to port and lost {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} of [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] at her bow.&lt;ref name="[http://www.navweaps.com/index_inro/INRO_Bismarck_p1.htm Garzke and Dulin, Bismarck's Final Battle, part 1.]"/&gt;

[[File:Bismarck hit.png|thumb|A modern reconstruction showing a 14-inch shell from HMS ''Prince of Wales'' penetrating ''Bismarck''{{'}}s bow.]]
The Germans held their fire until 05:55, when both German ships fired on ''Hood''. Lütjens did not immediately give the order to begin firing. ''Bismarck''{{'}}s first gunnery officer, ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' [[Adalbert Schneider]], asked "{{lang|de|Frage Feuererlaubnis?}}" (Permission to open fire?) several times without receiving a response, until the captain of ''Bismarck, '' ''[[Kapitän zur See]]'' [[Ernst Lindemann]], impatiently responded: "{{lang|de|Ich lasse mir doch nicht mein Schiff unter dem Arsch wegschießen. Feuererlaubnis!}}" (I'm not letting my ship get shot out from under my arse. Open fire!)&lt;ref&gt;Grützner 2010, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

A shell hit ''Hood''{{'}}s boat deck, starting a sizable fire in the ready-use {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} ammunition store but this fire did not spread to other areas of the ship or cause the later explosion. It is possible that ''Hood'' was struck again at the base of her bridge and in her foretop radar director. There has been contention over which German vessel struck ''Hood''; ''Prinz Eugen'' (''Kapitän zur See'' [[Helmuth Brinkmann]]), was firing at  ''Prince of Wales'', following an order from the fleet commander.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kbismarck.com/operheini.html Rico, Operation Rheinübung] see sections, ''Jot! Dora'' and ''The Destruction of the Hood''. www.kbismarck.com&lt;/ref&gt; The Gunnery Officer of ''Prinz Eugen'', Paul Schmalenbach is quoted as saying that ''Prinz Eugen'''s target was ''Hood''.&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau 2002, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinking of ''Hood''===
[[File:060529 Hood explosion sketch.jpg|thumb|A sketch prepared by [[John Leach (Naval Officer)|Captain JC Leach]] (commanding HMS ''Prince of Wales'') for the 2nd Board of Enquiry, 1941. The sketch represents the column of smoke or flame that erupted from the vicinity of the mainmast immediately before a huge detonation which obliterated the after part of the ship from view. This phenomenon is believed to have been the result of a cordite fire venting through the engine-room ventilators (see article).]]

At 06:00, Holland ordered his force to turn once again to port to ensure that the aft main guns on both ''Hood'' and ''Prince of Wales'' could bear on the German ships. In terms of the force balance this would nominally give Holland's force the advantage of 18 large caliber (14/15 in.) guns (10 in ''Prince of Wales'', 8 in ''Hood''); to 8 (8 - 15 in. in ''Bismarck'').

During the turn, a salvo from ''Bismarck'', fired from about {{convert|9|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}}, was seen by men aboard ''Prince of Wales'' to straddle ''Hood'' abreast her mainmast.  This straddle meant that some of the salvos fell to port, some to starboard (of the hull), and some; precisely aligned over the center of the main deck of ''Hood''.  It is likely that one {{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} shell struck somewhere between ''Hood''{{'}}s mainmast and "X" turret aft of the mast. A huge pillar of flame that shot upward 'like a giant blowtorch,' in the vicinity of the mainmast.{{#tag:ref|[http://www.hmshood.com/hoodtoday/2001expedition/index.htm Allan and Bevand, ''The Pursuit of Bismarck &amp; the Sinking of H.M.S. Hood'']. Despite maintaining a high rate of fire Hood scored no hits during the engagement and she appears to have continued to engage Prinz Eugen throughout the action.|group=nb}}

This was followed by an explosion that destroyed a large portion of the ship from amidships clear to the rear of "Y" turret, blowing both after turrets into the sea. The ship broke in two and the stern fell away and sank. Ted Briggs, one of the survivors, claimed ''Hood'' heeled to 30 degrees at which point 'we knew she just wasn't coming back'. The bow rose clear of the water, pointed upward, pivoted about and sank shortly after the stern. "A" turret fired a salvo while in this upright position, possibly from the doomed gun crew, just before the bow section sank.{{#tag:ref|[http://www.hmshood.com/hoodtoday/2001expedition/index.htm Allan and Bevand, ''The Pursuit of Bismarck &amp; the Sinking of H.M.S. Hood'']. Despite maintaining a high rate of fire Hood scored no hits during the engagement and she appears to have continued to engage Prinz Eugen throughout the action.|group=nb}}

Splinters rained down on ''Prince of Wales'' {{convert|.5|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} away. ''Hood'' sank in about three minutes with 1,415 members of the crew. Only [[Ted Briggs]], Bob Tilburn and Bill Dundas survived to be rescued two hours later by the destroyer {{HMS|Electra|H27|6}}.

The Admiralty later concluded that the most likely explanation for the loss of ''Hood'' was a penetration of her [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]] by a {{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} shell from ''Bismarck'', causing the explosion. Recent research with submersible craft suggests that the initial explosion was in the aft {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} magazine and that it spread to the {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} magazines via the ammunition trunks. It has been suggested from examination of the wreckage, found in 2001, that the magazine explosion in the {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} armament near the mainmast caused the vertical blast of flame seen there, and this in turn ignited the magazines of the aft {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns that caused the explosion that wrecked the stern. This explosion might have travelled through the starboard fuel tanks, igniting the fuel oil there, setting off the forward magazines and completing the destruction of the ship.

The wreck of ''Hood'' revealed the bow section bereft of any structure. A huge section of her side is missing, from the 'A' barbette to the foredeck. The midship section had its plates curled outward.

===''Prince of Wales'' alone===

''Prince of Wales'' found herself steering towards the sinking ''Hood''. Her commanding officer, Captain Leach, ordered an emergency avoidance turn away from ''Hood''{{'}}s wreckage. This violent change of course disrupted her aim and put her in a position that made it easier for the Germans to target her. She resumed her previous course, but was now under the concentrated fire of both German ships. ''Prince of Wales'' was struck four times by ''Bismarck'' and three times by ''Prinz Eugen''. One shell passed through her upper [[superstructure]], killing or wounding several crewmen in the Compass Platform and Air Defence Platform. Pieces of another shell struck her radar office aft, killing the crewmen within.&lt;ref name="Garzke and Dulin, p.181"&gt;Garzke and Dulin 1980, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{convert|20.3|cm|in|abbr=on}} shell from ''Prinz Eugen'' found its way to the propelling charge/round manipulation chamber below the aft {{convert|5.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} gun turrets, and a {{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} shell from ''Bismarck'' hit underwater below the armour belt, penetrating about {{convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on}} into the ship's hull, about {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} below the waterline, but was stopped by the anti-torpedo bulkhead. Fortunately for ''Prince of Wales'', neither shell exploded, but she still suffered minor flooding and the loss of some fuel oil. Contrary to some mistaken opinion, the {{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} shell that struck ''Prince of Wales'' below the waterline did not endanger her magazines, as it came to rest abreast an auxiliary machinery room.&lt;ref name="Garzke and Dulin, p.181"/&gt;

By this time, serious gunnery malfunctions had caused intermittent problems with the main armament, leading to a 26% reduction in output.{{#tag:ref|{{cite book |title=ADM 234/509: H.M.S.

No. 2 and No. 4 guns suffered from intermittent safety interlock problems. "A" turret suffered from water entering the lower portion of the turret/barbette structure, but there is no indication that this caused any problems other than discomfort for the crew. At Salvo 18, when ''Prince of Wales'' turned away, three of 'A' turret's guns were in operation. "B" Turret: No problems reported. At Salvo 18, when ''Prince of Wales'' turned away, both of 'B' turrets guns were in operation. "Y" Turret No.2 gun had loading problems and missed salvo 14 onwards. No.3 gun had problems with safety interlocks causing it to miss salvos 15 to 20. At salvo 18, when ''Prince of Wales'' turned away, two of "Y" turrets guns were in operation. "Y" turrets shell transfer ring jammed at salvo 20, due to a shell sliding out of its tray due to the motion of the ship as ''Prince of Wales'' turned.

In summary, three guns in "A" turret, two guns in "B" turret, and two guns in "Y" turret, were in operation at salvo 18 when ''Prince of Wales'' turned away, for a total of seven guns in operation.|group=nb}}{{#tag:ref|[http://www.bismarck-class.dk/bismarck/history/bisdenmarkstraitbattle.html The Battle of the Denmark Strait by John Asmussen]: ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' also suffered a loss of output.

''Prinz Eugen'' "Total 184 possible shots Actually fired = 157"|group=nb}} According to Captain Leach, he decided that continuing the action would risk losing ''Prince of Wales'' without inflicting further damage on the enemy. He therefore ordered the ship to make smoke and withdraw, 'pending a more favourable opportunity'.&lt;ref&gt;Chesneau 2004, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prince of Wales'' turned away just after 06:04, firing from her rear turret under local control until the turret suffered a jammed shell ring,{{#tag:ref|Naval Staff History, ''German Capital Ships and Raiders in WW2, Battle Summary No. 5'', p8.

Despite efforts by crew members and civilian technicians to repair the shell ring, it took until 08:25 for all four guns to be back in service, although two of the guns were serviceable by 07:20.&lt;ref name="Naval Staff History p8"/&gt; This temporarily left only five&lt;ref&gt;Bennett 2003, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roskill, The War at Sea, Vol 1, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|"As ''Prince of Wales'' turned away at 06:13, "Y" turret jammed, temporarily leaving only two out of ten 14-inch guns operational":''Garzke and Dulin, 1980. p. 190.''

===Breaking off the action===
On ''Bismarck'' there was tremendous elation at the sinking of ''Hood''. There was also a keen expectation that they would close on ''Prince of Wales'' and possibly finish her off. Lindemann requested that Lütjens allow ''Bismarck'' to do just that. Even if Tovey's squadron had left [[Scapa Flow]] the previous day, he would still be more than {{convert|300|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} away from ''Bismarck'' – even if ''Bismarck'' diverted to sink ''Prince of Wales'' (a chase Lindemann calculated would take only two or three hours).&lt;ref&gt;Bercuson and Herwig 2001, pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lütjens refused to allow Lindemann to give chase, giving no explanation. Lindemann repeated his request, this time more assertively.&lt;ref name="Bercuson and Herwig 2001, p. 166."&gt;Bercuson and Herwig 2001, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Lütjens held firm orders from the German Naval Commander, ''Groß Admiral'' [[Erich Raeder]], to avoid unnecessary combat with the Royal Navy, especially when it could lead to further damage that could hasten delivering ''Bismarck'' toward the waiting hands of the British. He broke off combat instead of pursuing ''Prince of Wales''&lt;ref name="Barnett 2004, p. 295."&gt;Barnett 2004, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; and ordered a course of 270°, due west.&lt;ref name="Bercuson and Herwig 2001, p. 166."/&gt; ''Bismarck'' had fired 93 of her 353 base-fused Armour Piercing (AP) shells during the engagement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kbismarck.com/armament.html Bismarck's armament].&lt;/ref&gt;

This clash between the two senior German officers reflected their disparate and distinct command functions. As captain of ''Bismarck'', Lindemann operated first and foremost as a tactician. As such, he had no doubt that his ship's immediate objective was to destroy ''Prince of Wales'', and he had pressed his case as far and hard as he should. Lütjens, as fleet chief and task force commander, operated at the strategic and operational levels. To some degree, his orders were clear – attacking convoys was his priority, not risking "a major engagement for limited, and perhaps uncertain, goals".  Nevertheless, Raeder had also ordered Lütjens to be bold and imaginative, to accept battle if unavoidable and conduct it vigorously to the finish.&lt;ref name="Bercuson and Herwig 2001, pp. 166-167."&gt;Bercuson and Herwig 2001, pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reality was that Lütjens' orders did not cover a spectacular success like the one just achieved. His priority therefore was to stick to his instructions - to concentrate on sinking merchant shipping and avoid encounters with enemy warships whenever possible.&lt;ref name="ken98"/&gt; Moreover, before leaving Germany, Lütjens had told Admirals Conrad Patzig and [[Wilhelm Marschall]], that he would adhere to Raeder's directives. This meant he did not intend to become the third fleet chief to be relieved for contradicting Raeder's orders; Marschall, one of his two predecessors, had been relieved of command for not following his orders to the letter despite the fact that Marschall's analysis of the changes in the tactical situation since the orders were issued resulted in the sinking of the British aircraft carrier {{HMS|Glorious||6}} and its two escorting destroyers. Nor was he predisposed to discuss his command decisions with a subordinate officer.&lt;ref name="Bercuson and Herwig 2001, pp. 166-167."/&gt;

Even if he had known it was the untried ''Prince of Wales'' he was fighting and not ''King George V'', Lütjens would probably have stuck to his decision. Following her would have meant exposing the squadron to further gunfire as well as to torpedo attacks from ''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk''. He would have risked his ships and crews on an expressly forbidden opportunity.&lt;ref name= "ken98"&gt;Kennedy, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 06:19 and 06:25, ''Suffolk'' fired six salvoes in the direction of ''Bismarck'', having mistaken a radar contact with an aircraft for ''Bismarck''. ''Suffolk'' was actually out of gun range of both ''Bismarck'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Dewar, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:HMS Suffolk Captain.jpg|thumb|300px|Captain Robert Meyric Ellis of ''Suffolk'' remains on the bridge for lunch whilst shadowing ''Bismarck''.]]

Holland's death led to responsibility for ''Prince of Wales'' falling to Wake-Walker in ''Norfolk''. With this command came the responsibility of coping with ''Bismarck'' until enough British warships could concentrate and destroy her. His choice was either to renew the action with ''Bismarck'', or ensure that she be intercepted and brought to action by other heavy units. Wake-Walker chose the latter course, continuing to shadow the German ships. Further offensive action, he concluded, would cause more damage to ''Prince of Wales'' than to ''Bismarck'' and endanger his cruisers, plus he knew Tovey was on his way. He ordered ''Prince of Wales'' to follow ''Norfolk'' at her best speed, so that ''Norfolk'' and ''Suffolk'' could fall back on her if attacked. At 07:57 ''Suffolk'' reported that ''Bismarck'' had reduced speed and appeared damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, 297–299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''Bismarck''{{'}}s receiving the first hit in the forecastle, all six of the ship's 26-man damage control teams had worked ceaselessly to repair the damage.{{explain|date=January 2018}} When it was reported that the tips of the starboard propeller could be seen above water, Lindemann had ordered counterflooding two compartments aft to restore the ship's trim. He then sent divers into the forecastle to connect the forward fuel tanks, containing a much-needed {{convert|1000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of fuel, first to the tanks near the forward boiler then to the rear fuel tank by way of a provisional line running over the upper deck.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bercuson and Herwig 2001, pp. 169–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both these manoeuvres failed. Lindemann then requested permission to slow ''Bismarck'' and heel the ship first to one side then the other to weld patches from the inside to the holes in the forward hull. Lütjens refused, again without comment. Eventually, he had to agree to slow the ship to {{convert|22|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} to allow [[hammock]]s and collision matting to be stuffed in the holes of the No. 2 boiler room and the auxiliary boiler room to stop the growing ingress of seawater. This attempt also failed. Boiler Room No. 2 was shut down, with a loss of speed to {{convert|28|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As well as taking on seawater, ''Bismarck'' was leaking fuel oil. Lütjens ordered ''Prinz Eugen'' to drop back and see how much of a [[wake|trail]] she was leaving astern. The carpet of oil was broad enough to cover both sides of the ship's wake, was all colours of the rainbow and gave off a strong smell – all of which helped disclose ''Bismarck''{{'}}s location.&lt;ref&gt;Bercuson and Herwig 2001, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 2004, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage to ''Bismarck''{{'}}s forward fuel tanks, combined with a missed opportunity to refuel at [[Bergen]] earlier in the voyage, left less than {{convert|3000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of fuel remaining, not enough to operate effectively against the Atlantic convoys.&lt;ref name="Barnett 2004, p. 295."/&gt; The element of surprise – which was considered essential for the operation's success – had most definitely been lost; the German ships continued to be shadowed by Wake-Walker's squadron.&lt;ref&gt;Bercuson and Herwig 2001, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Lütjens concluded that he needed to abort ''Bismarck''{{'}}s mission and head toward a convenient dockyard for repairs.&lt;ref name="Barnett 2004, p. 295."/&gt;

The question was which dockyard to head for. The nearest friendly ports were Bergen and [[Trondheim]] in [[Norway]], a little over {{convert|1000|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} away. Steaming in that direction meant a return passage north or south of Iceland, with the enemy's air forces now fully alerted to their presence and the possibility of other heavy units between them and Scapa Flow. Lütjens knew his intelligence was unreliable. ''Hood'' had been reported by Group North to be off West Africa and there had been no reports of a ''King George V''-class battleship in the vicinity.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2004, p. 100."&gt;Kennedy 2004, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disregarding Lindemann's recommendation to return to Bergen,&lt;ref&gt;Bercuson and Herwig 2001, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Lütjens ordered ''Bismarck'' to head for the French port of [[Saint-Nazaire]].&lt;ref name="Barnett 2004, p. 295."/&gt; Although the French coast was {{convert|600|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} further away than Bergen, Saint-Nazaire held the potential of longer nights and wider seas in which to shake off ''Bismarck''{{'}}s shadowers, plus the possibility of luring them across a line of [[U-boat]]s. It would leave ''Bismarck'' poised on the edge of the British trade routes once the damage were repaired; it also meant the potential support of the battleships {{Ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{Ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2004, p. 100."/&gt; Both ships had been stationed at [[Brest, France|Brest]] in France, since the end of [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation Berlin]] earlier that year but had been kept in port for repairs and overhaul. While Brest was closer than Saint-Nazaire, it was within range of Royal Air Force bombers.&lt;ref&gt;Bercuson and Herwig 2001, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lütjens detached the undamaged ''Prinz Eugen'' to continue raiding on her own. The cruiser went further south into the Atlantic, where she refuelled from a tanker at sea. She suffered engine trouble, abandoned her commerce raiding mission without having sunk any merchant ships, and made it to Brest.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
===German===
News of Lütjens' decision was received with shock in Berlin, [[Wilhelmshaven]] and Paris. A blizzard of urgent telephone calls raced across German-occupied Europe. While the Berlin Admiralty was satisfied with Lütjens' success, it was tempered by news of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s damage and the decision to head for France. Grand Admiral Raeder was not clear whether Lütjens intended to steam for St. Nazaire immediately or after shaking off his pursuers and oiling in mid-Atlantic. Raeder immediately conferred with his chief of staff, Admiral [[Otto Schniewind]], who in turn telephoned Admiral [[Rolf Carls]], who commanded Group North in Wilhelmshaven.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2004, pp. 100–101"&gt;Kennedy 2004, pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carls had already drafted a message recalling Lütjens to Germany, but had not yet sent it. Schniewind pointed out that at noon Lütjens had crossed the demarcation line between the Northern Hebrides and Southern Greenland, thus passing from Group North's operational control to Group West; therefore, the decision to recall Lütjens was no longer Carls' to make. A subsequent call to Group West's commander, Admiral [[Alfred Saalwächter]], revealed that he did not plan to recall Lütjens and that he felt such a decision should be discussed between Schniewind and Raeder.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2004, pp. 100–101"/&gt;

Raeder was against issuing a recall himself, telling Schniewind they did not know enough about the situation at hand and that the person who would best know would be Lütjens.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 2004, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; He then telephoned [[Adolf Hitler]], who was at the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. Hitler received the news of ''Hood''{{'}}s sinking stoically, exhibiting neither joy nor any other triumphant behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bercuson and Herwig 2001, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; After hearing Raeder's report, he turned to those who were with him and expressed his personal thoughts:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If now these British cruisers are maintaining contact and Lütjens has sunk the ''Hood'' and nearly crippled the other, which was brand new and having trouble with her guns during the action, why didn't he sink her too? Why hasn't he tried to get out of there or why hasn't he turned around?&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Müllenheim-Rechberg, ''Battleship Bismarck'', 149.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

News of ''Hood''{{'}}s destruction was seized upon more enthusiastically by Dr. [[Joseph Goebbels]]' Propaganda Ministry. That evening it was broadcast to the nation, accompanied by "We march against England" and other martial airs. The German public, already enjoying the news of [[Luftwaffe]] victories over the Royal Navy off [[Crete]], received the news of ''Hood''{{'}}s sinking euphorically.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2004, p. 100."/&gt;

===British===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
The British public were shocked that their most emblematic warship had been destroyed so suddenly, with the loss of more than 1,400 of her crew. The Admiralty mobilised every available warship in the Atlantic to hunt down and destroy ''Bismarck''. The Royal Navy forces pursued and brought ''Bismarck'' to [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|battle]]. The German battleship was sunk on the morning of 27 May.

Moves were subsequently made to court-martial Wake-Walker and Captain John Leach of ''Prince of Wales''.{{#tag:ref|Kennedy expounds on the court martial claim via the epilogue in ''Pursuit - The Sinking of the Bismarck''. According to Kennedy the claim for a proposal to court martial Leach and Wake-Walker came from post war letters written by Admiral Tovey, after he retired, and not from Admiralty sources. Kennedy states in his epilogue that "...later in life Tovey's memory let him down..." and that plus the fact that Leach and Wake-Walker were retained in their commands and given commendations must cast considerable doubt on the court martial proposal.|group=nb}} The view was taken that they were wrong not to have continued the battle with ''Bismarck'' after ''Hood'' had been sunk. John Tovey, Commander-in-Chief of the [[Home Fleet]], was appalled at this criticism. A row ensued between Tovey and his superior, Admiral [[Dudley Pound|Sir Dudley Pound]]. Tovey stated that the two officers had acted correctly, ensuring that the German ships were tracked and not endangering their ships needlessly. Furthermore, ''Prince of Wales''{{'}}s main guns had repeatedly malfunctioned and she could not have matched ''Bismarck''. Tovey threatened to resign his position and appear at any court-martial as 'defendant's friend' and defence witness. No more was heard of the proposal.

A British [[Naval Board of Inquiry|board of enquiry]] quickly investigated the cause of ''Hood''{{'}}s explosion and produced a report. After criticism that the initial enquiry did not record all the available evidence, a second board of enquiry more extensively investigated ''Hood''{{'}}s loss, and examined the vulnerabilities of other large British warships still in service in light of the probable causes of the explosion. It, like the first enquiry, concluded that a {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} shell from ''Bismarck'' caused the explosion of ''Hood''{{'}}s aft ammunition magazines. This led to refitting some older British warships with increased protection for their ammunition magazines and some other related improvements.

Many naval historians and writers have analyzed the ''Bismarck'' engagement and weighed the participants' decisions. One of the most debated is Lütjens' decision to proceed into the Atlantic rather than continue the battle.

==Parallels to Jutland==
A number of parallels could be drawn from Holland's actions in this battle and those of Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]] in the opening stages of the [[Battle of Jutland]]. From his actions, it seems clear that Holland felt he had to engage ''Bismarck'' immediately, rather than support Wake-Walker in shadowing until Force 'H' could arrive. Beatty, likewise, felt he needed to engage German Admiral [[Franz von Hipper|Franz Hipper]]'s battlecruisers with his own forces instead of drawing the Germans toward Admiral [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]] and the [[British Grand Fleet]].&lt;ref name="Barnett 1991, p. 292."/&gt;

Holland, like Beatty, possessed superiority in the number of heavy ships he possessed, yet he was encumbered by an inferiority in the fighting effectiveness of those units. Moreover, Holland's deployment of his units compared to Beatty's deployment at Jutland. Beatty and Holland both attacked while German units were well before the beam. As a result, the midships and after turrets of Beatty's ships could barely fire on the enemy. Holland's ships could not use their after turrets until the final turn to port just before ''Hood'' was sunk.&lt;ref name="Barnett 1991, p. 292."/&gt;

Beatty placed his lighter-armoured battlecruisers at the head of his line, leaving the more powerful and better-armoured [[Queen Elizabeth-class battleship|''Queen Elizabeth''s]] in the rear. Likewise, Holland placed the old and vulnerable ''Hood'' ahead of the better armoured (albeit new and untested) ''Prince of Wales''. Both admirals exercised tight tactical control over their units from their flagships. This prevented Captain Leach from manoeuvring ''Prince of Wales'' independently and possibly taking a different line of approach that might have confused the Germans.&lt;ref name="Barnett 1991, p. 292."/&gt;
