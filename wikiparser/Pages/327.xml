The '''Battle of the Caucasus''' is a name given to a series of Axis and Soviet operations in the [[Caucasus]] area on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] of [[World War II]]. On 25 July 1942, German troops captured [[Rostov-on-Don]], Russia, opening the Caucasus region of the southern [[Soviet Union]], and the oil fields beyond at [[Maykop|Maikop]], [[Grozny]], and ultimately [[Baku]], to the Germans. Two days prior, [[Adolf Hitler]] issued a directive to launch such an operation into the Caucasus region, to be named Operation Edelweiß. German forces were compelled to withdraw from the area that winter as [[Operation Little Saturn]] threatened to cut them off.

==Order of battle==

===Red Army===
*[[North Caucasian Front]] (Marshal [[Semyon Budenny]]) - until September 1942
*[[Transcaucasian Front]] (General of the Army [[Ivan Tyulenev]])
*[[Black Sea Fleet]] (Vice Admiral [[Filipp Oktyabrsky]])
*[[Azov Sea Flotilla]] (Rear Admiral [[Sergey Gorshkov]])

===Wehrmacht===
[[Army Group A]] - [[General Field Marshal]] (''Generalfeldmarschall'') [[Wilhelm List]]
*[[1st Panzer Army]]- [[General]] [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Paul von Kleist]]
*[[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th Army]] - [[Colonel-General]] (''Generaloberst'') [[Richard Ruoff]]
*[[Romanian Third Army|3rd Romanian Army]] - General [[Petre Dumitrescu]]

==German operations==
{{redirect|Operation Edelweiss|the 1954 West German war film|Operation Edelweiss (film)}}
[[Operation Edelweiss]], named after [[Edelweiss|the mountain flower]], was a German plan to gain control over the [[Caucasus]] and capture the [[Oil industry in Azerbaijan#World War II|oil fields of Baku]] during the [[Soviet-German War]]. The operation was authorised by [[Hitler]] on 23 July 1942. The main forces included [[Army Group A]] commanded by [[Wilhelm List]], [[1st Panzer Army]] ([[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]]), [[4th Panzer Army]] (Colonel-General [[Hermann Hoth]]), [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th Army]] (Colonel-General [[Richard Ruoff]]), part of the [[Luftflotte 4]] (Generalfeldmarschall [[Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen]]) and the [[Romanian Third Army|3rd Romanian Army]] (General [[Petre Dumitrescu]]). Army Group A was supported to the east by [[Army Group B]] commanded by [[Fedor von Bock]] and by the remaining 4th Air Fleet aircraft (1,000 aircraft in all). The land forces, accompanied by 15,000 oil industry workers, included 167,000 troopers, 4,540 guns and 1,130 tanks.

===Preparations===
Several oil firms such as "German Oil on Caucasus", "Ost-Öl" and "Karpaten-Öl" had been established in Germany. They were awarded an exclusive 99-year lease to exploit the Caucasian oil fields. For this purpose, a large number of pipes—which later proved useful to Soviet oil industry workers—were delivered. A special economic inspection "A", headed by Lieutenant-General Nidenfuhr was created. Bombing of the oil fields was forbidden. To defend them from destruction by Soviet units under the command of [[Nikolai Baibakov]] and [[Semyon Budyonny]], an [[SS]] guard regiment and a [[Cossack]] regiment were formed. The head of the [[Abwehr]] developed Operation [[Sonderkommando Schamil|''Schamil'']], which called for landing in the [[Grozny]], [[Malgobek]] and [[Maykop|Maikop]] regions. They would be supported by the [[1940–1944 Chechnya insurgency|local fifth column]].

===Events===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-031-2417-09, Russland, Kaukasus, Gebirgsjäger.jpg|thumb|German soldiers in the Caucasus (1942)]] 
[[File:Ww2 map23 july42 Nov 42.jpg|thumb|The front from July to November 1942]]
After neutralizing the Soviet counter-attack in the Izyum-Barvenkovsk direction the German Army Group A rapidly attacked towards the Caucasus. When [[Rostov-on-Don]], nicknamed "The Gates of Caucasus," fell on 23 July 1942, the tank units of Ewald von Kleist moved towards the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasian Mountain]] Range. The "Edelweiss" division commander, [[Hubert Lanz]], decided to advance through the gorges of rivers of the [[Kuban River]] basin and by crossing the Marukhskiy Pass (Maly Zelenchuk River), Teberda, Uchkulan reach the Klukhorskiy Pass, and simultaneously through the Khotyu-tau Pass block the upper reaches of the Baksan River and the Donguz-Orun and Becho passes.

Concurrently with the outflanking maneuvers, the Caucasian Mountain Range was supposed to be crossed through such passes as Sancharo, Klukhorskiy and Marukhskiy to reach [[Kutaisi]], [[Zugdidi]], [[Sukhumi]] and the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Georgian]] capital city of [[Tbilisi]]. The units of the [[4th Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|4th German Mountain Division]], manned with [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrolean]]s, were active in this thrust. They succeeded in advancing 30&amp;nbsp;km toward Sukhumi. To attack from the Kuban region, capture the passes that led to [[Elbrus]], and cover the "Edelweiss" flank, a vanguard detachment of 150 men commanded by Captain (Hauptmann) Heinz Groth, was formed. From the Old Karachay through the Khurzuk [[aul]] and the Ullu-kam Gorge the detachment reached the Khotyu-tau Pass, which had not been defended by the Soviet troops. Khotyu-tau gained a new name — "The Pass of General Konrad".

The starting point of the operation on the [[Krasnodar]]-[[Pyatigorsk]]-Maikop line was reached on 10 August 1942. On 16 August the battalion commanded by von Hirschfeld made a feint and reached the Kadar Gorge. On 21 August troops from the [[1st Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Mountain Division]] planted the flag of Nazi Germany on the summit of [[Mount Elbrus]], the highest peak in both the Caucasus and Europe.

*3 August 1942 - [[Wehrmacht]] takes [[Stavropol]]
*10 August 1942 - Wehrmacht takes [[Maykop]]
*12 August 1942 - Wehrmacht takes [[Krasnodar]]
*25 August 1942 - Wehrmacht takes [[Mozdok, Republic of North Ossetia–Alania|Mozdok]]
*11 September 1942 - Wehrmacht and Romanian Army take [[Novorossiysk]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Forczyk, ''The Caucasus 1942–43: Kleist’s race for oil''&lt;/ref&gt;
*End of September 1942 - Wehrmacht blitzkrieg stopped at two [[Chechen-Ingush ASSR]] towns: [[Malgobek]] and [[Vladikavkaz]]

==Soviet operations== 
[[File:Ww2 map25 Dec42 Feb43.jpg|thumb|The front from December 1942 to February 1943]]

[[File:Medal defense of Caucasus.jpg|thumb|Some 870,000 Soviet personnel were awarded this [[Medal "For the Defence of the Caucasus"]] from 1 May 1944.]]

===1941===
There were no military operations in the region in 1941. But the region was affected by warfare elsewhere in the Soviet Union.

In his memoirs, Soviet [[Transcaucasian Front]] commander [[Ivan Tiulenev]] recounts how thousands of civilians attempted to flee from [[Ukraine]] to the comparatively safe Caspian ports, such as [[Makhachkala]] and [[Baku]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The Caucasus area became a new area of industry when 226 factories were evacuated there during the industrial evacuations undertaken by the Soviet Union in 1941. After the Grozny to [[Kiev]] line was captured during Axis advances, a new link between [[Moscow]] and [[Transcaucasia]] was established with the construction of the new [[railway line]] running from [[Baku]] to [[Orsk]] (via [[Astrakhan]]), bypassing the front line at [[Grozny]], while a shipping line was maintained over the [[Caspian Sea]] through the town of [[Krasnovodsk]] in [[Turkmenistan]].

===1942===
In 1942, the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] launched Operation Edelweiss which was aimed at advancing to the [[oil in Azerbaijan|oil field of Azerbaijan]]. The German offensive slowed as it entered the mountains in the southern Caucasus and did not reach all of its 1942 objectives. After the Soviet breakthroughs in the region around [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], the German forces in the Caucasus were put on the defensive.

Soviet military operations included
:[[Tikhoretsk-Stavropol Defensive Operation]] (25 July – 5 August 1942)
:[[Armavir-Maikop Defensive Operation]] (6–17 August 1942)
:[[Novorossiysk Defensive Operation]] (19 August – 26 September 1942)
:[[Mozdok-Malgobek Defensive Operation]] (1–28 September 1942)
:[[Tuapse Defensive Operation]] (25 September – 20 December 1942)
:[[Nalckik-Ordzhonikidze Defensive Operation]] (25 October – 12 November 1942)

===1943===
[[File:Части Красной армии входят в освобождённый Моздок.jpg|thumb|Red Army units enter the liberated city of Mozdok (January 1943).]]
In early 1943, the Germans began to withdraw and consolidate their positions in the region due to setbacks elsewhere. They established a defensive line ([[Kuban bridgehead]]) in the [[Taman Peninsula]] from which they hoped to eventually launch new operations in the Caucasus. The fighting remained reasonably static until September 1943 when the Germans ordered fresh withdrawals which effectively ended the period of fighting in the Caucasus.

Soviet Operations in 1943 consisted of the following.

:[[Salsk-Rostov Offensive]] (1 January 1943 – 4 February 1943)
:[[Mozdok-Stavropol Offensive]] (1 January 1943 – 24 January 1943)
:[[Novorossiysk-Maikop Offensive]] (11 January 1943 – 4 February 1943)
:[[Tikhoretsk-Eisk Offensive]] (24 January 1943 – 4 February 1943)

:[[Novorossiysk-Taman Operation]] (10 September – 9 October 1943)
The key military base of [[Novorossiysk]] was retaken in September, 1943.

*3 January 1943 - [[Red Army]] retake [[Mozdok]]
*21 January 1943 - Red Army retake [[Stavropol]]
*23 January 1943 - Red Army retake [[Armavir, Russia|Armavir]]
*29 January 1943 - Red Army retake [[Maykop]]
*4 February 1943 - Soviet marines beat off a German attempt to land at [[Malaya Zemlya]]
*5 February 1943 - Soviet forces landing in [[Novorossiysk]]
*12 February 1943 - Red Army retake [[Krasnodar]]
*9 September 1943 - the Germans begin to retreat from the ''Blue Line'' defensive positions
*16 September 1943 - Red Army occupies [[Novorossiysk]]
*9 October 1943 - Red Army controls the whole of the [[Taman Peninsula]]

===1944===
During the [[Dnieper–Carpathian Offensive|Winter Spring Campaign of 1944]] (1 January - 31 May), the Soviet army was able to launch an [[Crimean offensive|invasion of the Crimea]] from the Caucasus, which was fully recaptured by 12 May 1944.

Operations included:
:[[Kerch–Eltigen Operation|Kerch-Eltingen Amphibious Offensive Operation]] (31 October 1943 – 11 December 1944)
:[[Perekop–Sevastopol Offensive]] (8 April 1944 – 12 May 1944)
:[[Kerch–Sevastopol Offensive]] (11 April 1944 – 12 May 1944)
