'''Operation Nordlicht''' ("Northern Light") was devised by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] high command, the ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' ("High Command of the Army") after a [[Siege of Leningrad|year-long battle for Leningrad]] when [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered a final assault on the besieged city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feldgrau.com/august.html |title=World War II Axis Military History Day-by-Day: August 23 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Feldgrau |accessdate=28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main objective of the operation was to capture [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] using forces of [[Army Group North]] under [[Field Marshal]] [[Georg von KÃ¼chler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rateitall.com/i-886718-operation-nordlicht.aspx |title=Operation Nordlicht |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716065324/http://www.rateitall.com/i-886718-operation-nordlicht.aspx |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and thereby bring an end to the siege and free up hundreds of thousands of troops. Meanwhile, the Germans were also preparing for the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. Both attacks on Leningrad in the North and on [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]] in the South were synchronized by the Germans so as to confuse the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]].

Operation Nordlicht was to begin on 23 August 1942 with a massive artillery bombardment of Leningrad, following with aerial bombardments by the [[Luftwaffe]]. But when the Soviets launched the [[Sinyavino Offensive (1942)|Sinyavino Offensive]] on 19 August, the forces that were intended to be used for Nordlicht were transferred from the planned offensive to the defense of the German lines. Although the Sinyavino Offensive was a failure, it caused the Germans to cancel their operation and they were never able to launch an offensive against Leningrad again.
