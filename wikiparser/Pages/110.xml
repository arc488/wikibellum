The '''Battle of Ortona''' (20–28 December 1943)&lt;ref name="dates"&gt;[http://www.wwii.ca/page44.html Canada at War website: Battle of Ortona]&lt;/ref&gt; was a battle fought between two battalions of elite German ''[[Fallschirmjäger (World War II)|Fallschirmjäger]]'' ([[Paratrooper|paratroops]]) from the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|German 1st Parachute Division]] under ''[[Generalleutnant]]'' [[Richard Heidrich]], and assaulting [[Canadian Army|Canadian troops]] from the [[1st Canadian Division|Canadian 1st Infantry Division]] under [[Major general|Major General]] [[Chris Vokes]], most of whom were fresh recruits whose [[baptism of fire]] was during the [[Invasion of Sicily]]. It was the culmination of the fighting on the Adriatic front in Italy during '''"Bloody December"'''. The battle was known to those who fought it as the "Italian [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]],"&lt;ref name="Zuehlke 1999"&gt;Zuehlke (1999)
 {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; for the brutality of its close-quarters combat, which was only worsened by the chaotic rubble of the town and the many [[booby trap]]s used by both sides. The battle took place in the small [[Adriatic Sea]] town of [[Ortona]], with a peacetime population of 10,000.

Part of the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)]], the battle to liberate Ortona resulted in 2,300 Canadian casualties in a single month (including 500 dead) before the town was won for the Allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z7E-j1UWuOMC&amp;pg=PA495&amp;dq=ortona+canadian+engineers#v=onepage|title=Canada's Army: Waging War and Keeping the Peace|author=J.

==Background==
[[File:Italy1943Sango+MoroCampaigns.svg|thumb|left|Communities around the [[Moro (Italian river)|Moro River]]. Ortona was a city of strategic importance, as one of Italy's few deep water ports on the east coast.]]

By late 1943, the entire Italian campaign was not intended to win the war but to remove Italian troops from other areas of Europe, divert German forces from France and reduce the strength of the German army; the [[Invasion of Normandy|D-Day invasion]] was already in the planning stages for the following spring or summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pzL7VE3o24wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mouse+holing+ortona+canadian#v=onepage|title=Ortona: Canada's Epic World War II Battle|author=Mark Zuehlke |page=4|date=1 November 2003|publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre|isbn=1550545574 |accessdate=26 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one source indicates, "By dividing Nazi forces between several separate fronts, the Allies would prevent Hitler from striking a deadly blow at the USSR or from concentrating an invincible army along the coast of Normandy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.junobeach.org/canada-in-wwii/articles/the-italian-campaign/ |website=Juno Beach Centre|date=11 October 2011|title=CANADA IN THE SECOND WORLD WAR - The Italian Campaign |accessdate=26 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]'s offensive on the [[Winter Line]] defences east of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine mountains]] had commenced on 23 November with the crossing of the river [[Sangro]]. By the end of the month, the main Gustav Line defences had been penetrated and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops were fighting their way forward to the next river, the [[Moro River Campaign|Moro]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} north of the mouth of which lay [[Ortona]]. For the Moro crossing in early December the exhausted [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 78th Infantry Division]] on the Allied right flank on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]] had been relieved by the [[1st Canadian Division|Canadian 1st Infantry Division]], under [[Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]].&lt;ref&gt;Zuehlke (1999), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-December, after fierce fighting in the cold and mud, the Division's [[1st Brigade (Canada)|1st Infantry Brigade]] had fought its way to within {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} of Ortona and was relieved by the [[2nd Brigade (Canada)|2nd Infantry Brigade]] for the advance on the town.

Some historians indicate that Ortona was of high strategic importance, as it was one of Italy's few usable deep water ports on the east coast, and was needed for docking allied ships and to shorten Eighth Army's lines of supply which at the time stretched back to [[Bari]] and [[Taranto]]. Allied forces were ordered to maintain the offensive, and going through the built-up areas in and around Ortona was the only feasible option. Ortona was part of the Winter Line defence system and the Germans had constructed a series of interlocking defensive positions in the town. This—together with the fact that the Germans had been ordered to "fight for every last house and tree"—&lt;ref&gt;Farley Mowat, ''And No Birds Sang''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zuehlke160"&gt;Zuehlke (1999), p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; made the town a formidable obstacle to any attacking force.

Other historians, including [[Rick Atkinson]], assign lesser importance for Ortona. He quotes Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]] who said, "We do not want to defend Ortona decisively .. but the English have made it appear as important as Rome"; General [[Joachim Lemelsen]], the temporary commander, replied, "It costs so much in blood, it cannot be justified".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FBZJWEME4eIC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=ortona+2300+canadian+casualties#v=onepage|title=The Day of Battle: The War in Sicily and Italy, 1943-1944|author=Rick Atkinson|page=306|date=14 September 2002|publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division|isbn=9780805088618|accessdate=26 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Allies believed it would be merely a minor battle and proceeded with the plan; the Germans then rose to the occasion, holding the town with great determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pzL7VE3o24wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mouse+holing+ortona+canadian#v=onepage|title=Ortona: Canada's Epic World War II Battle|author=Mark Zuehlke |pages=31, 283|date=1 November 2003|publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre|isbn=1550545574 |accessdate=26 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
[[File:Ortona1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The battle saw house-to-house combat between the [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|German 1st Parachute Division]] and the [[1st Canadian Division|Canadian First Infantry Division]].]]
The Canadians faced elements of the renowned [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|German 1st Parachute Division]].{{#tag:ref|"the best German troops in Italy" in [General] Alexander's estimation. Atkinson 2013, p. 303|group=Note}} These soldiers were battle-hardened after many years of war, and defended doggedly.

The initial Canadian attack on the town was made on 20 December by Canadian 2nd Brigade's [[Loyal Edmonton Regiment]] with elements of the [[Seaforth Highlanders of Canada]] under command.&lt;ref name="Zuehlke160"/&gt; Meanwhile, elements of the division's 3rd Infantry Brigade launched a northerly attack to the west of the town in attempt to outflank and cut off the town's rear communications but made slow progress because of the difficult terrain and the skillful and determined German defence. On 21 December 1943, the Loyal Edmonton Regiment and the Seaforth Highlanders entered Ortona, assisted by the tanks of the [[1st Canadian Armoured Brigade]]'s [[Three Rivers Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cmea-agmc.ca/heritage-moment/mouse-holing-ortona|website=Danube Travel|date=26 October 2016|title=Mouse Holing at Ortona|accessdate=18 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mouse-holing===
The Germans had concealed various [[machine gun]]s and [[Anti-tank gun|anti-tank]] emplacements throughout the town, making movement by armour and infantry increasingly difficult.&lt;ref name="Bercuson, p. 175"&gt;Bercuson, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The house-to-house fighting was vicious and the Canadians made use of a tactic that had previously infrequently been used: "[[mouse-holing]]". This tactic involved using weapons such as the [[PIAT]] or cumbersome Teller anti-tank mines to create a large aperture in the wall of a building, as houses within Ortona shared adjoining walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pzL7VE3o24wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mouse+holing+ortona+canadian#v=onepage|title=Ortona: Canada's Epic World War II Battle|author=Mark Zuehlke |pages=286–287|date=1 November 2003|publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre|isbn=1550545574 |accessdate=26 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bercuson, p. 175"/&gt; The soldiers would then throw in grenades and make their assault through the mouse holes, clearing the stairs to the top or bottom floor with grenades or machine guns; they would follow to reach any adversaries and struggle in repeated close-quarters combat.&lt;ref name="Zuehlke160"/&gt; Mouse-holing was also used to pierce through walls into adjoining rooms, sometimes catching enemy troops by surprise. The tactic would be used repeatedly as assaulting through the streets caused heavy casualties for both Canadian and German troops.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, p. 305-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mouse-holing also allowed the soldiers to progress through the town, building by building, without entering the streets where they would face enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W4IKaP7qoaAC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=mouse+holing+ortona#v=onepage|title=Last Man Standing: The Life of Smokey Smith, Vc, 1914-2005|author=Thomas Glen Lockhart |page=26|date=27 November 2012|publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre|isbn=978-1460201992 |accessdate=26 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some sources attribute the strategy to the Canadian forces, a British training film of 1941 had already illustrated the concept. The Canadians were certainly early, effective and courageous users of the technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pzL7VE3o24wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mouse+holing+ortona+canadian#v=onepage|title=Ortona: Canada's Epic World War II Battle|author=Mark Zuehlke |page=286|date=1 November 2003|publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre|isbn=1550545574 |accessdate=26 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the battle, engineers on both sides also used the brutal but effective tactic of using demolition charges to collapse entire buildings on top of enemy troops.&lt;ref&gt;Zuehlke (1999), p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pzL7VE3o24wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mouse+holing+ortona+canadian#v=onepage|title=Ortona: Canada's Epic World War II Battle|author=Mark Zuehlke |page=287|date=1 November 2003|publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre|isbn=1550545574 |accessdate=26 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December, after eight days of fighting, the depleted German troops finally withdrew from the town. The Canadians suffered 1,375 dead&lt;ref name="CCas"&gt;Zuehlke (1999),{{Page needed|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the Moro River battles of which Ortona was one part. This represented almost a quarter of all Canadians killed during the entire Italian Campaign.&lt;ref name="veterans.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/those-who-served/christmas-at-the-front/history/orton|website=Veterans Canada|date=27 April 2005|title=Remembering a bloody Christmas in Ortona |accessdate=26 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Ortona was successfully liberated but the month would be considered as "Bloody December" by Canadian forces because of the numerous casualties in and around the town.&lt;ref name="veterans.gc.ca"/&gt; As well, over 5,000 Canadians were evacuated due to battle exhaustion and illness. In addition to the Canadian losses, the German 1st Parachute Division and the [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)]] also suffered numerous casualties. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KyNlm8SuplEC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=German+1st+Parachute+Division.+ortona#v=onepage|title=Canadian Military Atlas: Four Centuries of Conflict from New France to Kosovo|author=Mark Zuehlke, C.

The contribution made by Canadian troops was summarized as follows by Major General [[Christopher Vokes]] in his report on the Ortona offensive: "We smashed the 90th Panzer Grenadier Division and we gave the 1st German Parachute Division a mauling which it will long remember".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=The Canadians in Italy 1943-1945 Volume II|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2009/forces/D2-502E.pdf |journal=Publications Canada  |pages=339 |accessdate=26 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, after WW II, the significance of the battle in Ortona was minimized by others, perhaps because it did not have a significant impact on winning the war.

In November 2000, the Government of Canada erected a plaque at the Piazza Plebiscito in Ortona, in recognition of the battle as a National Historic Event of Canada that "symbolized the efforts of the Canadian Army in the Italian Campaign during World War II". The plaque reads as follows: "In early December 1943 the 1st Canadian Infantry Division and 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade began their most savage battle of the Italian Campaign. In the mud and rain troops attacked from the Moro River to Ortona. Then, from house to house and room to room there raged a ferocious battle against resolute German defenders. With extraordinary courage the Canadians prevailed, and just after Christmas finally secured the town".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=1925|website=Parks Canada |date=15 November 2000|title=Battle for Ortona National Historic Event of Canada|accessdate=26 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
