The '''Battle of Cape Passero''' (1940), was a [[World War II|Second World War]] naval engagement between the [[Royal Navy|British]] [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Ajax|22|6}} and seven [[torpedo boat]]s and [[destroyer]]s of the Italian [[Regia Marina]], southeast of [[Sicily]], in the early hours of 12 October 1940. It took place in the aftermath of a British [[Malta Convoys|supply operation]] to [[Malta]].

==Background==
In October 1940, the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] mounted a resupply operation to Malta from [[Alexandria]], designated ''MB6''. The convoy had four [[cargo ship]]s escorted by two [[Cruiser#Anti-aircraft cruisers|anti-aircraft cruisers]] and four destroyers. The screening force was led by [[Vice Admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Sir Andrew Cunningham]]'s [[flagship]], {{HMS|Warspite|03|6}}, and included three other [[battleship]]s, two [[aircraft carrier]]s, six cruisers, and 16 destroyers. The only remarkable incident during the convoy was some damage to the destroyer {{HMS|Imperial|D09|6}} when she ran into a minefield. The merchantmen reached their destination on 11 October. Until then, bad weather had prevented the intervention of the Italian Fleet. An aircraft spotted the returning ships shortly after they had left Malta. Meanwhile, HMS ''Ajax'' was detached from the other cruisers for a scouting mission.&lt;ref&gt;Green &amp; Massignani, page 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engagement==
The Italian commander—Admiral [[Inigo Campioni]]—ordered a force of destroyers to [[Cape Bon]], in case the British warships were going to [[Gibraltar]]. In Campioni's view, it was too late for the Italian battleships and cruisers to operate against the convoy. A flotilla of four destroyers and three torpedo boats was, at the same time, patrolling between 35° 45’ N and 35° 25′N,&lt;ref&gt;De la Sierra, page 122.&lt;/ref&gt; at about {{convert|3|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} apart, in full moonlight.&lt;ref name="Greene &amp; Massignani, page 97"&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, page 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian destroyers—all [[Soldati class destroyer|Soldati-class]]—were the ''Artigliere'', ''Camicia Nera'', [[Italian destroyer Aviere (1937)|Aviere]], and ''Geniere''. The torpedo boats were the [[Spica class torpedo boat|Spica-class]] ''Ariel'', ''Alcione'', and ''Airone''.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torpedo boat action===
At 01:37, ''Ajax'' was sighted by ''Alcione'', steaming eastward, {{convert|19600|yd|m|abbr=on}} away on the [[Port (nautical)|port side]]. At 01:48, the three torpedo boats were closing the British cruiser at full speed. The cruiser was completely unaware of the enemy approach.&lt;ref&gt;De la Sierra, page 123.&lt;/ref&gt; At 01:57, ''Alcione'' fired two torpedoes from a range of {{convert|1900|yd|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Greene &amp; Massignani, page 97"/&gt; Captain Banfi, commander of the Italian formation, ordered the flagship ''Airone'' to open fire on the enemy with her {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns, followed by her sister ships. Three rounds hit home, two on the bridge and the third {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}} below the waterline.&lt;ref&gt;De la Sierra, page 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ajax'' realised she was under attack and opened fire on the nearest torpedo boat—''Ariel''—while at full speed. ''Ariel'' was shattered by the salvos and sank 20 minutes later, although she may have been able to fire a torpedo.&lt;ref name="Greene &amp; Massignani, page 98"&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, page 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Mario Ruta, his second in command, and most of the crew were killed.&lt;ref name="De la Sierra, page 125"&gt;De la Sierra, page 125.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Airone'' was the next Italian ship to be hit. She managed to launch two torpedoes before being disabled, catching fire almost immediately, her bridge and upper deck machine-gunned by ''Ajax'' at short range.&lt;ref name="Greene &amp; Massignani, page 98"/&gt; She sank a few hours later. Banfi was among the survivors. Then ''Alcione''—the only Italian warship undamaged—broke contact at 02:03.&lt;ref name="De la Sierra, page 125"/&gt;

===Destroyer action===
Meanwhile, after manoeuvring during the fighting, ''Ajax'' resumed her course to the eastward. At 02:15, her [[fire-control radar]] detected two Italian destroyers, whose commander—Captain [[Carlo Margottini]]—had sighted the firing from the south. A radio malfunction had prevented Margottini from attacking in full strength, when three of his destroyers had headed north-west, instead of north as ordered.&lt;ref&gt;De la Sierra, pp. 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aviere'' was battered by a sudden broadside from the British cruiser, forestalling a torpedo attack, and was forced to withdraw southwards, heavily damaged.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;De la Sierra, page 126.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Artigliere'' managed to fire a torpedo and four full {{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun salvos at {{convert|2800|yd|m|abbr=on}} before being hit and crippled. The torpedo missed, but four rounds struck two of ''Ajax''’s secondary gun turrets,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; destroyed her port [[Whaleboat|whaler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = H.M.

She had fired 490 rounds of different calibres and four torpedoes. Thirteen of her ship's company had been killed and 22 wounded, while the cruiser required a month of repairs before she returned to active service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regiamarina.net/engagements/capopassero/capopassero_us.htm#prof |title=www.regiamarina.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318211359/http://www.regiamarina.net/engagements/capopassero/capopassero_us.htm#prof |archivedate=18 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disabled ''Artigliere''—with her commander and most staff officers killed—was taken in tow by ''Camicia Nera''. They were surprised at first light by the cruiser {{HMS|York|90|6}}, which drove off ''Camicia Nera'' before sinking the drifting ''Artigliere'' with a torpedo. The survivors were rescued the next day by the Italian Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Green &amp; Massignani, page 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
This action had been the ''Regia Marina''’s first experience of the Royal Navy's superior skills and equipment in night actions. The extensive use of [[Star shell#Illumination|starshells]], searchlights and incendiary rounds by the Royal Navy had to be countered, before the Italians could close the technical gap. They also suspected the enemy's use of radar, but at this time it was only speculation.&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, page 99, quotes the Italian memo: "Every progress in this field will be of paramount importance and perhaps the most important element to organise will be to co-ordinate the employment of searchlights and flares shells from the outset of the action."&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that poor Italian air surveillance had prevented a quick reaction by the Italian heavy units, handing the tactical advantage to the British of avoiding contact in unfavourable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Bragadin, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
