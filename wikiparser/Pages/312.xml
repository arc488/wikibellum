The '''Battle of Bryansk''' (2–21 October 1941) was a twenty-day battle during [[World War II]] conducted in the [[Bryansk Oblast]] as a part of the overall [[Battle for Moscow|Moscow campaign]].  Returning from the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|Kiev operation]], [[Heinz Guderian]] attacked in an unexpected direction capturing Bryansk and [[Oryol]] with few casualties thereby encircling two Soviet formations, the [[13th Army (Soviet Union)|13th Army]] and [[3rd Army (Soviet Union)|3rd Army]].  A third Soviet formation, the [[50th Army (Soviet Union)|50th Army]] was encircled by infantry of the German [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|2nd Army]] north of Bryansk.  However the encircled Red Army units continued fighting, delaying the drive on Moscow for two weeks.  This delay, as well as the casualties taken by the [[Wehrmacht]] liquidating the pockets contributed to the German collapse at the gates of [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow]]. See also: [[Battle of Moscow#The Battles of Vyazma and Bryansk|Vyazma and Bryansk pockets]]. As a result of this battle, the Germans occupied Bryansk until they were expelled by the Red Army on 17 September 1943 as a part of the [[Battle of Smolensk (1943)|Smolensk campaign]].

While he was recovering from injuries sustained in the battle, [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] began working on the firearm that would one day become the [[AK-47]].

==Background and planning==
After the successful encirclement of the reconstituted [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]] in the [[Battle of Smolensk (1941)|Smolensk pocket]], the tanks of [[Army Group Centre]] were ordered to halt so that the infantry could catch up and liquidate the pocket.  Further to the north, [[Army Group North]] had stalled out in the drive towards [[Siege of Leningrad|Leningrad]], and [[Army Group South]] was struggling to take [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|Kiev]].  To secure the flanks of Army Group Center, Hitler ordered that the [[3rd Panzer Army]] be diverted north and the [[2nd Panzer Army]] be diverted south.&lt;ref name="Battlefield"&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Dave Flitton, Andy Aitken, James Wignall | title = Battlefield, S2, E3 | medium =Documentary Television | publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service]] | location = United States | date = 1996 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAfcOYKMPP4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army Group Centre's infantry formations, the [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th Army]] and [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]] were ordered to dig in and wait for their flanks to be secured.

During the "lull" in the offensive, the Red Army General Staff, the [[Stavka]] ordered Red Army formations around Smolensk and Bryansk to conduct frontal assaults on Army Group Center in an effort to drive the [[Wehrmacht]] back from the approaches to Moscow.&lt;ref name="Soviet Storm EP1"&gt;{{cite AV media | people =Anna Grazhdan, Artem Drabkin, Aleksey Isaev | title ="Soviet Storm: World War 2 in the East, Episode 1" | medium = Television | publisher = [[Channel One Russia OJSC]] | location = Russia | date = 2011 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A6UWkK2U4s}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offensives were conducted over poor terrain against units in strong defensive positions and nearly all of them were disasters that seriously weakened Red Army formations defending the approaches to Moscow.&lt;ref name="Ziemke"&gt;{{cite book | last =Ziemke | first =Earl F | title = "Stalingrad to Berlin: The German Defeat in the East" | publisher =Center of Military History, United States Army | edition = 2002 | date = 1968 | location = Washington DC | pages = 31 | language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
In September 1941, the German troops of XLVII. Armeekorps (mot.) (commander General &lt;!-- -leutnant --&gt; of Panzer troops [[Joachim Lemelsen]]) advanced towards, and crossed the [[Desna River]] in the region southwest of Moscow. During the breakthrough attack, the German troops broke through the [[Bryansk Front]] on 30 September, during the operation to encircle the [[50th Army (Soviet Union)|50th Army]]. This resulted in the penetration of the Front's position between the 50th and [[13th Army (Soviet Union)|13th Armies]].
The Bryansk Front commander [[Andrei Yeremenko]] adopted a [[defence in depth]] strategy, with the Front's reserves consisting of two rifle, one tank division and one tank brigade concentrated in the Bryansk area. However, in the course of the operation the troops of the XXXXVII Corps took [[Karachev]] and were able to advance to east of the city on 6 October while trying to link up with the XXXXIII Corps coming from the opposite direction.

This forced the Red Army's 50th and 13th Armies and the Operational Group of General Major A.N. Yermakov to withdraw in order to avoid encirclement, and consequently Bryansk was evacuated without significant fighting.  Regardless of this, the city was subjected to heavy artillery and air bombardment which destroyed large parts of [[Bryansk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://velikvoy.narod.ru/bitvy/1941/oryol-bryansk.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610111902/http://velikvoy.narod.ru/bitvy/1941/oryol-bryansk.htm |archivedate=10 June 2008}} Orel-Bryansk Defensive Operation (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Army, as part of the [[Orel-Bryansk Defensive Operation]] (30 September 1941 – 23 October 1941) lost over 80,000 killed in and around the area of the city, with around 4062 soldiers injured and hospitalized&lt;ref name="LK"&gt;Kahaner, Larry. "Weapon changed pattern of modern war." 29 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Another 50,000 prisoners were taken, before XXXXVII Corps proceeded on to its next objective, [[Oryol|Orel]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

==Aftermath==
By virtue of Guderian's one-armed encirclement, the Germans had destroyed all of the Red Army forces defending the southern approaches to Moscow, opening the way to [[Tula, Russia|Tula]].  Tula stood at the center of the road and rail network south of Moscow and its capture was vital to the Moscow Offensive.  After the encirclement of the Bryansk Front, Guderian was closer to Tula than the nearest Red Army formation.  However, the delay in liquidating the pocket bought the [[Stavka]] precious time to rush in reinforcements south of Moscow, stabilizing the front.  When Guderian resumed the drive, he failed to capture Tula, and instead opted to bypass the city.  This put a severe logistical constraint on the rest of the Moscow campaign.  When Stalin ordered the Moscow Counter-Attack in December, Red Army control of Tula forced Guderian to withdraw the [[2nd Panzer Army]] from Moscow, in violation of a direct order from Hitler.  This resulted in Guderian's dismissal in January 1942.  In honor of its determined stand, Tula was awarded the title of [[Hero City]] in 1976.

=== Inspiration for the AK-47 ===
[[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] was a senior sergeant ([[tank commander]]) serving on the [[T-34]]s of the 24th Tank Regiment, [[12th Tank Division (Soviet Union)|12th Tank Division]]&lt;ref name="p.27 Perechen No.6"&gt;p.27 Perechen No.6&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[8th Mechanised Corps (Soviet Union)|8th Mechanised Corps]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mechcorps.rkka.ru/files/mechcorps/pages/8_meh.htm |title=8 механизированный корпус |last=Drig |first=Yevgeny |date=20 December 2009 |website=mechcorps.rkka.ru |language=Russian |trans-title=8th Mechanized Corps |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624010559/http://mechcorps.rkka.ru/files/mechcorps/pages/8_meh.htm |archive-date=24 June 2013 |access-date=3 September 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; stationed in [[Stryi]] (31 [[KV-1 (tank)|KV-1]] and 10 [[T-34]] tanks) before retreating after the [[Battle of Brody (1941)|Battle of Brody]], with the regiment soon to become a part of the [[159th Tank Brigade (Soviet Union)|159th Tank Brigade]].&lt;ref name="p.27 Perechen No.6"/&gt; He was wounded during the battle, but made it to a hospital on foot, where he received medical attention. This was not Kalashnikov's first battle as he had also participated in the [[Battle of Brody (1941)|Battle of Brody]] where his division was part of the 8th Mechanized Corps that encountered the German [[16th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|16th Panzer Division]] in battle around [[Leshuv]]. While recovering from his injuries, Kalashnikov started [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|experiencing flashbacks]] of the raid and "became obsessed with creating a submachine gun that would drive the Germans from his homeland."&lt;ref name="LK"/&gt;
