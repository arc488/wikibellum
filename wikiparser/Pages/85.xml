The '''Capture of Klisura Pass''' ({{lang-el|Κατάληψη της Κλεισούρας}}) was a military operation that took place during 6–11 January 1941 in southern [[Albania]], and was one of the most important battles of the [[Greco-Italian War]]. The [[Royal Italian Army during World War II|Italian Army]], initially deployed on the Greek-Albanian border, launched a major offensive against Greece on 28 October 1940. After a two-week conflict, Greece managed to repel the invading Italians in the battles of [[Battle of Pindus|Pindus]] and [[Battle of Elaia–Kalamas|Elaia–Kalamas]]. Beginning on 9 November, the Greek forces launched a major counteroffensive and penetrated deep into Italian-held Albanian territory. The Greek operations culminated with the capture of the strategically important [[Gorge of Këlcyrë|Klisura Pass]] on January 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1990 | title = Balkan studies: biannual publication of the Institute for Balkan Studies | journal = Balkan Studies | volume = 33| page = 116 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gI9pAAAAMAAJ&amp;cd=1&amp;dq=kleisoura%2Bcapture%2Bitalians%2B1940&amp;q=kleisoura#search_anchor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After its successful counter-attack and the [[Battle of Morava–Ivan]], the [[Hellenic Army]] penetrated deep into Italian-held Albanian territory, taking control of the local urban centers of [[Gjirokastër]] and [[Korçë]] by December 1940. In a war council on 5 December, General [[Alexander Papagos]], worried about the possibility of [[Nazi Germany|German]] intervention in support of the Italians, attempted to hasten the advance. Moreover, Generals [[Ioannis Pitsikas|Pitsikas]] and [[Georgios Tsolakoglou|Tsolakoglou]] suggested the immediate capture of the Klisura Pass so as to secure the Greek positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Sakellariou|first= M.

During the period of the Greek counter-offensive, the Greek forces had much greater distances to contend with and their logistics and road network were substantially inferior compared to the Italians. The Klisura Pass was a particularly strategic location near the town of [[Berat]] and the topography of the terrain in addition to bad weather made the operation extremely difficult.&lt;ref name=Hunt28&gt;{{cite book | last=Hunt |first= David| title=A don at war: Cass Series on Politics and Military Affairs in the Twentieth Century | publisher= Routledge | year=1990 | editor= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AwoNpLkKq3UC&amp;q=kleisura#v=snippet&amp;q=kleisura&amp;f=false| page = 28 | isbn=978-0-7146-3383-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==

The attack was led by the [[II Army Corps (Greece)|II Army Corps]], and especially by the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st]] and [[11th Infantry Division (Greece)|11th]] divisions.&lt;ref name=Army&gt;Army History Directorate (Greece).

The final assault that resulted in the location's capture was led by the recently arrived [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Division]], which consisted mainly of [[Crete|Cretans]].&lt;ref name=Hunt28/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sir Hunt |first= David| title=Greece in the Second World War | publisher= Ball State University| year=1995 | editor= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BTBnAAAAMAAJ&amp;cd=7&amp;dq=klissoura%2B1941&amp;q=%22Klissoura+was+a+position+immensely+strong+by+nature%2C+but+on+10+January+1941+it+fell+to+an+impetuous+assault+of+the+5th+Division%2C+brought+recently+from+Crete%22#search_anchor | page = 23 | isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian headquarters immediately launched counterattacks to recapture the sector. Italian Supreme Commander [[Ugo Cavallero]] ordered the newly arrived [[7th Infantry Division Lupi di Toscana|''Lupi di Toscana'' Division]] to support the [[3rd Alpine Division Julia|''Julia'' Alpine Division]], but the operation was ill-prepared. Although they faced only four Greek battalions, they rapidly lost one battalion of their own due to encirclement. By 11 January, the Italian attack had been pushed back and over the next days, the ''Lupi di Toscana'' were almost annihilated. This failure secured Greek possession of the pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= MacGregor |first= Knox| title=Mussolini unleashed, 1939–1941: politics and strategy in fascist Italy's last war | publisher= Cambridge University Press | year=1986 | editor= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FNjxX7uZYQEC&amp;q=klisura#v=snippet&amp;q=klisura&amp;f=false| pages = 258–259 |isbn=978-0-521-33835-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The capture of the strategic pass by the Greek army was considered a major success by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces, with the Commander of the [[Middle East Command|British forces in the Middle East]], [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], sending a congratulatory message to Alexander Papagos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hadjipateras C.N.| author2= Chatzēpateras Kōstas N.| author3= Fafalios M.S.| author4= Phaphaliou Maria S.| title=Greece 1940–41 eyewitnessed | year=1996 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vvpmAAAAMAAJ&amp;cd=6&amp;dq=klissoura%2B1941&amp;q=klissoura#search_anchor| publisher= Efstathiadis Group | page = 97 | isbn=978-960-226-533-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following weeks, the front lines stabilized, with the Greek forces facing a bad logistical situation and the Italians managing to gain numerical superiority in order to stop their retreat. Both sides kept their positions until the [[Battle of Greece|German intervention]] in April 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mario |last=Cervi |title=The Hollow Legions |publisher=Chatto and Windus|location=London |year=1972 |pages = 309, 320 |isbn=0-7011-1351-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22 2018, following an agreement between the Greek and Albanian foreign ministers, a systematic effort to recover the bodies of fallen Greek soldiers from the battle was undertaken between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/225126/article/ekathimerini/news/mfa-welcomes-measures-to-disinter-identify-fallen-greek-soldiers-in-albaniaD|title=MFA welcomes measures to disinter, identify fallen Greek soldiers in Albania|website=ekathimerini}}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="protothema"&gt;[http://www.protothema.gr/world/article/753214/istoriki-stigmi-xekinise-i-ektafi-ton-ellinon-pesodon-tou-40-sto-metopo-tis-alvanias/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;[http://www.tribune.gr/greece/news/article/429714/429714.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the Greek soldiers will be buried in the Greek military cemetery located within the pass.&lt;ref name="tribune"/&gt;
