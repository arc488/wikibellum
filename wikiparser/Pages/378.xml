The '''Lublin–Brest Offensive''' ({{lang-ru|Люблин‐Брестская наступательная операция}}, 18 July – 2 August 1944) was a part of the [[Operation Bagration]] strategic offensive by the Soviet [[Red Army]] to clear the [[Nazi German]] forces from the [[Eastern Poland]] and [[Western Belarus]]. The offensive was executed by the left (southern) wing of the [[1st Belorussian Front]] and took place during July 1944; it was opposed by the German [[Army Group North Ukraine]] and [[Army Group Centre]].

The operation was accompanied by several other offensives, particularly the [[Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive]] of the [[1st Ukrainian Front]] in the south; both offensives launched weeks after the start of the successful [[Operation Bagration]] to the north which cleared German forces from most of [[Belarus]].

After reaching its target objectives, the offensive momentum carried on as the Soviet forces advanced on [[Warsaw]] during August (2 August – 30 September 1944); however Soviet forces did not aid the Polish [[Warsaw Uprising]], which is a matter of some controversy.

==Opposing forces==
On 15 June, [[Army Group North Ukraine]] under command of [[Josef Harpe]] was composed of the [[4th Panzer Army]], [[1st Panzer Army]], and the [[First Army (Hungary)]]. [[Army Group Centre]] had the [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|2nd Army]], [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th Army]], [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]] and [[3rd Panzer Army]].

The Soviet [[1st Belorussian Front]] under command of [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] included the [[8th Guards Army|8th Guards]], [[28th Army (Soviet Union)|28th]], [[47th Army (Soviet Union)|47th]], [[61st Army (Soviet Union)|61st]], [[65th Army (Soviet Union)|65th]], [[69th Army (Soviet Union)|69th]], and [[70th Army (Soviet Union)|70th (Combined Arms) Armies]], [[2nd Guards Tank Army (Soviet Union)|2nd Tank Army]], [[6th Air Army|6th]] and [[16th Air Army|16th]] Air Armies, [[11th Tank Corps]], [[First Polish Army (1944-1945)|1st Polish Army]], [[2nd Guards Cavalry Corps|2nd Guards]] and [[7th Guards Cavalry Corps]].

==The offensive: securing Lublin and Brest==

The Lublin-Brest region was first used as a feint, on 9–10 July drawing German attention away from Soviet offensive preparations at [[Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive]]. After the success of that offensive, clearly visible in the first days (from 13 July), [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]]’s started a serious push westwards in the Lublin-Brest area as well.&lt;ref name = "Titans"&gt;When Titans…&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July five armies of the 1st Belorussian Front (including one Polish army, the [[First Polish Army (1944-1945)|Polish First Army]]) deployed on the front’s left wing south of the [[Pinsk Marshes]], struck and shattered the defenses of [[Army Group North Ukraine]] [[4th Panzer Army]] west of [[Kovel]]. Within hours, the front’s [[2nd Guards Tank Army (Soviet Union)|2nd Tank Army]] and several mobile corps began exploiting success to the west with the infantry following in their wake.&lt;ref name = "Glantz"&gt;Glantz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieutenant General [[Nikolai Gusev]]'s [[47th Army]] and Colonel General [[Vasily Chuikov]]'s [[8th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|8th Guards Army]] broke through the German defenses, and by 21 July they had reached the eastern banks of the [[Bug River]]. The following day, Lieutenant General [[Semyon Bogdanov]]'s 2nd Tank Army began to advance toward Lublin and the [[Vistula]] river, while [[11th Tank Corps|11th Tank]] and [[2nd Guards Cavalry Corps]] spearheaded a northwest push toward [[Siedlce]], with the aim of preventing the retreat of [[Army Group Center]] forces which were fighting around the cities of Brest and Bialystok.&lt;ref name = "Titans" /&gt; Nazi concentration camp [[Maidanek]] near Lublin was liberated on 22 July. General Bogdanov was wounded on 23 July during the fighting for Lublin; the 2nd Tank Army was taken over by Major General [[A. I. Radzievsky]]. Despite the change of command, the Soviet rapid advance continued, as the lead elements of 8th Guards Army and 2nd Tank Army reached the eastern banks of Vistula on 25 July.&lt;ref name = "Titans" /&gt; A day earlier, on 24 July, [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]]’s forces took [[Lublin]] and advanced westward towards Vistula, south of the Polish capital of Warsaw.&lt;ref name = "Glantz" /&gt; The [[Stavka|Soviet High Command]] (Stavka) ordered Radzievsky to advance north toward Warsaw as part of the maneuver designed to prevent the retreat of Army Group Centre.&lt;ref name = "Titans" /&gt;

On 28 July [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] was taken.&lt;ref name="Brest"&gt;[http://www.brest-belarus.com/History_1900_2005.shtml#section10  Brest, Belarus]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2 August, the 1st Belorussian Front’s left wing armies seized [[bridgehead]]s over the Vistula at [[Magnuszew]] (Chuikov's 47th Army) and [[Puławy]] (Lieutenant General V. la. Kolpakchi's 69th Army). Germans launched several counterattacks on those vital bridgeheads. [[Army Group Centre]]'s [[XLVI Panzer Corps]] conducted counter-attacks from August 8 to reduce the bridgehead.&lt;ref name=hinzep400&gt;Hinze, p.400&lt;/ref&gt; The [[19th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|19th]] and ''[[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring|Hermann Göring]]'' Panzer Divisions mounted several assaults during early August, but the Soviet lines remained firm, managing to retain their positions on the other shore; they would prove crucial during the upcoming [[Vistula-Oder Offensive]] that would cross central and western Poland and aim to bring the Soviets within the reach of [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=glantz&gt;See also Glantz, ''Failures of Historiography''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zalogap78&gt;Zaloga, pp.78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

Further battles of that period included the [[battle of Studzianki]].

==The controversy: bridgeheads instead of Warsaw==
{{See also|Lack of outside support in the Warsaw Uprising}}
During the offensive bringing the 1st Belorussian Front’s left wing closer to the Vistula River, the [[Polish Home Army]] (''Armia Krajowa'') staged [[Warsaw Uprising|an insurrection in Warsaw]]; the Soviet advance was one of the factors which accelerated the Uprising, as the Poles both counted on Soviet support and wanted to secure their capital independently (as part of the [[Operation Tempest]]).

Only days before the uprising begun in Warsaw (on 1 August), the [[Stavka]] (Soviet General Headquarters) commanded Rokossovsky to dispatch his 2nd Tank Army in direction of Warsaw’s eastern suburbs ([[Praga]]).&lt;ref name = "Glantz" /&gt;  By 28 July, Radzievsky's army, with three corps alongside, engaged the [[73rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|73rd Infantry Division]] and the [[Hermann Goering Panzer Division]] 40 kilometres southeast of Warsaw. Radzievsky wanted to secure the routes into Warsaw from the east, while the Germans aimed to prevent that and hold on to Warsaw.&lt;ref name = "Titans" /&gt; The 2nd Tank Army was to be protected on the right flank by a cavalry corps (the 2nd Guards) and the [[47th Army]], however it reached the region east of Warsaw on 29 July, before the slower 47th Army could provide support; the 47th Army and the 2nd Guards were engaged in the battle around [[Siedlce]], 50 kilometres to the east. Germans counterattacked, in what became known as the [[Battle of Radzymin (1944)|Battle of Radzymin]], with two panzer corps ([[XXXIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXIX]] and [[IV SS Panzer Corps|IV SS]]). On 29 July, Radzievsky ordered his [[8th Guards Tank Corps]] (under Lieutenant General [[A. F. Popov]]) and [[3rd Tank Corps]] (under Major General [[Nikolai Vedeneyev|N. D. Vedeneev]]) to advance northward (northeast of Warsaw) aiming to turn the German defenders' left flank, as the [[16th Tank Corps (Soviet Union)|16th Tank Corps]] engaged the Germans southeast of Warsaw. 8th Guards Tank Corps was able to fight its way 20 kilometres east of the city, the 3rd Tank Corps however was stopped by a series of successive counterattacks by German armored units under [[Walter Model]].

From 30 July, the Hermann Goering and [[19th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|19th Panzer Division]]s struck the overextended tank corps near [[Radzymin]], north of [[Wołomin]], 15 kilometres northeast of Warsaw. On 2 and 3 August, the [[4th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|4th Panzer Division]] and [[5th SS Panzergrenadier Division Wiking]] joined the German counteroffensive. As a result, the 3rd Tank Corps sustained heavy casualties, and the 8th Guards Tank Corps was also weakened. From 30 July through 5 August Germans succeeded in not only stopping the Soviet's advance but in pushing them back, inflicting heavy losses on the frontline Soviet units. By 5 August when the Soviet 47th Army's was able to enter the frontline struggle, the 2nd Tank Army had to be withdrawn. The three rifle corps of 47th Army had to hold the 80-kilometers frontline, stretching from south of Warsaw north to Siedlce. Without armor support, the 47th Army could not resume the offensive. German forces in the area were still holding and their link with the Army Group Centre in the east had been damaged but not cut.&lt;ref name = "Titans" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Glantz" /&gt;

Till 20 August, the 47th Army remained the only major Red Army unit in the vicinity of Warsaw. The Soviets made no attempt to aid the uprising, concentrating on securing Soviet positions east of the river, not providing the insurgents even with artillery support. At the time, the bulk of the 1st Belorussian Front’s centre and right wing were struggling to overcome German defences north of [[Siedlce]] on the approaches to the [[Narew River]] and, according to Soviet accounts, were unable to support any action to aid Warsaw directly. Western and contemporary Polish accounts claim that [[Joseph Stalin]] [[Lack of outside support in the Warsaw Uprising|deliberately withheld support for the Polish Home Army]] as he wanted the Home Army — supporting the [[Polish government in exile]], a competition to the pro‐Soviet [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] — to be destroyed.&lt;ref name = "Titans" /&gt;

On 20 August the [[First Polish Army (1944-1945)|1st Polish Army]] of General [[Zygmunt Berling]] joined the Soviet 47th Army. Red Army forces north of Warsaw finally advanced across the [[Bug River]] on 3 September, reached the [[Narew River]] the following day, and secured bridgeheads across that river on 6 September. Lead elements of two Polish divisions from the 1st Army attempted to cross the Vistula into Warsaw on 13 September but made little progress and having sustained heavy casualties were evacuated back across the river ten days later. The Uprising forces capitulated on 2 October; the Soviets would take Warsaw without a major battle during their advance early in 1945. American military historian [[David M. Glantz]] notes that while the Soviets could have taken Warsaw and aided the insurgents, from a purely military standpoint this would have required diverting efforts from attempts to secure bridgeheads south and north of Warsaw, involved the Soviets in costly city fighting and gained them less optimal positions for further offensives; this, coupled with political factors meant that the Soviet decision not to aid the Warsaw Uprising was based not only on political, but also on military considerations.&lt;ref name = "Glantz" /&gt;

==Aftermath: battle for the Narew bridgeheads==
The bridgeheads at [[Serock]], the confluence of the [[Bug River|Bug]] and [[Narew]] Rivers, had been established by the Soviet [[65th Army (Soviet Union)|65th Army]] at the end of the Lublin–Brest Offensive. The German [[XX Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XX Corps]] of [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|Second Army]] was deployed in defence.

On 3 October elements of the [[3rd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|3rd]] and [[25th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|25th Panzer Division]]s, supported by the [[252nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|252nd Infantry Division]], were thrown into an attack to eliminate the 65th Army's positions in the bridgehead.&lt;ref name=scheiderbauer&gt;See the account of Armin Scheiderbauer in Williams and Rodgers, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;  On the southern face, German units reached the bank of the Narew by 5 October. The memoirs of General [[Pavel Batov]], 65th Army's commander, describe committing the [[5th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|44th Guards Rifle Division]] in an attempt to halt the German advance.&lt;ref name=batov&gt;See Batov, В походах и боях, Moscow 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

An attack on the northern part of the bridgehead was planned for 8 October, involving the [[19th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|19th Panzer]] and Wiking divisions but the gains made were eliminated by a Soviet counter-attack on 14 October.&lt;ref name=wrp110&gt;Williams and Rodgers, p.110; Batov gives the date as 19 October&lt;/ref&gt;
