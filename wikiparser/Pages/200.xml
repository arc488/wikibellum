The '''Battle of La Ciotat''' was a naval engagement in August 1944 during [[World War II]] as part of [[Operation Dragoon]]. [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces, engaged at the main landings in [[Vichy France]], ordered a small flotilla of [[United States|American]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] warships to make a feint against the port city of [[La Ciotat]] as a diversion. The Allies hoped to draw [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces away from the main landing zones at [[Cavalaire-sur-Mer]], [[Saint-Tropez]] and [[Saint-Raphaël, Var|Saint Raphaël]]. During the operation, two German warships attacked the Allied [[flotilla]].

==Battle==
On 17 August 1944, the Allied command appointed [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[John D. Bulkeley]] to take charge of the operation. Bulkeley proceeded to La Ciotat with a force of one [[destroyer]], {{USS|Endicott|DD-495|6}}, 17 [[PT boat]]s and the British [[Insect class gunboat|Insect-class]] [[gunboat]]s [[Insect-class gunboat#Ships|HMS ''Scarab'']] and {{HMS|Aphis|1915|2}}. When the Allies arrived off La Ciotat, the PT boats and gunboats were sent in ahead of ''Endicott'' and sank a German merchant steamer in the harbor. The warships then bombarded targets in the city until two German ships were spotted. They were the former Italian {{sclass-|Gabbiano|corvette}} ''Antilope'', renamed ''UJ6082'' and the former [[Egypt]]ian [[Auxiliary cruiser|armed yacht]] ''Nimet Allah''. ''UJ6082'' was armed with one {{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun and two torpedo tubes. Her [[sister ship]] ''UJ6081'' had been sunk two days earlier at the [[Battle of Port Cros]]. The yacht mounted only a German [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]]/[[anti-tank warfare|anti-tank]] [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|{{convert|88|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} Flak gun]].

The two British gunboats engaged the Germans with their {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}} and 12-pounder weapons, but the enemy fire was so accurate that they were forced to withdraw. USS ''Endicott'', with only one {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} gun in operation, opened fire from within {{convert|1500|yd|m|abbr=on}} of the enemy ships. The Germans switched fire from the gunboats to ''Endicott'' and hit her, wounding one man, the only American casualty. Although a dud, the shell tore a large hole in ''Endicott''{{'}}s side. In an engagement that lasted just under an hour, the Americans and the Germans dueled at close range until both the corvette and the yacht were sunk. The Allies then resumed their bombardment of the city. When later asked why he engaged two enemy vessels which at the time outgunned his destroyer, Captain Bulkeley replied, "What else could I do? You engage, you fight, you win. That is the reputation of our Navy, then and in the future".

On the same day, American aircraft, just north of La Ciotat, dropped around 300 [[paradummy|dummy paratroopers]] and explosive devices that simulated rifle fire. German casualties are unknown, although ''Endicott'' rescued 169 sailors who became prisoners of war. John Bulkeley eventually rose to the rank of [[vice admiral]] in the [[United States Navy]], retiring from service in 1988.
