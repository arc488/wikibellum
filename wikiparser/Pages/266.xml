The '''Battle of Point Judith''' is the popular name for a naval engagement fought between the [[United States]] and [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]] on May 5 and 6, 1945. American [[surface combatant]]s and two [[blimp]]s sank a German [[U-boat]] off [[Point Judith, Rhode Island|Point Judith]], [[Rhode Island]] in one of the last actions of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. The '''SS ''Black Point''''' a 368-foot, 7500 tons [[Collier (ship)|coal ship]] was sunk at the start of the Battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmm.org/blackpoint.html usmm.org Black point ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background ==
[[German submarine U-853|''U-853'']] was one of five U-boats dispatched in February 1945 for operations off the North American coast. By May 1945, she was only one of the February boats remaining active and
was one of just six U-boats operating off the North American coast. On May 6, she was patrolling the coast off [[Rhode Island]].

The SS ''Black Point'' (originally named SS ''Fairmont'') was built in 1918 by the [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]] in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. The 5,353 ton collier ship was 112.35 meters long, with a beam of 16.82 meters and a draft of 9.3 meters. She was powered by 3 boilers that powered one 3-cylinder triple expansion engine that powered a single shaft to a single screw with 462 nhp. During [[World War 1]], she served in the US navy as the '''USS ''Fairmont'''''.  She was armed with one [[6"/53 caliber gun|6"]] deck gun and one [[QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss|6-pounder]] deck gun. After the WWI, she was renamed the '''SS ''Nebraskan''''' by the C.H. Sprague &amp; Son Corp. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?18631  wrecksite SS ''Black Point'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navsource.org/archives/12/172429.htm navsource.org Fairmont (ID 2429)]&lt;/ref&gt; By WWII, she was known as the SS ''Black Point''. On May 6 she was en route to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] with [[United States Navy Armed Guard]] onboard to protect the ship.

==Battle==
The President of the German Reich [[Karl Dönitz]] directed all U-boats to cease attacks on 4 May, ahead of Germany's surrender. While most commanding officers obeyed this order, some either did not receive it or chose to ignore it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cembrola |first1=Bob |title=The Mystery of U-853 – All U-Boats Had Orders to Surrender; Why Did This One Attack? |url=https://militaryhistorynow.com/2020/05/30/the-hunt-for-u-583-the-mystery-of-the-last-german-submarine-destroyed-by-the-u-s-navy-in-ww2/ |website=Military History Now |accessdate=31 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 May, ''U-853'' was lying in wait off Point Judith when she sighted the SS ''Black Point''. Two [[torpedo]]es from the U-Boat struck the ''Black Point'', one blew off the stern of the ship. Within 15 minutes. the ship capsized and sank in {{convert|95|ft|m|abbr=on}} of water. The SS ''Black Point'' would be the last American-flagged merchant ship to be sunk in WWII. Of those aboard, 11 crewmen and one Navy guard died; 34 others were rescued by nearby vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lynch|first1=Adam|title=Kill and Be Killed? The U-853 Mystery|url=http://www.usni.org/magazines/navalhistory/2008-06/kill-and-be-killed-u-853-mystery.|website=U.S. Naval Institute|accessdate=29 March 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A radio report about the torpedoing from one of the rescue ships, the SS ''Kamen'', was picked up by US Navy's [[Eastern Sea Frontier]] command in [[New York City|New York]] and by the [[United States naval districts|1st Naval District]] in [[Boston]]. The nearest warships, which were under the command of Commander F. C. McCune, were part of Task Force 60.7 (TF60.7). The escort group consisted of [[destroyer]] {{USS|Ericsson|DD-440|6}} (Lt.Cdr CA Baldwin), [[destroyer escort]]s {{USS|Amick|DE-168|6}} (Lt.Cdr EL Barsumian) and {{USS|Atherton|DE-169|2}} (Lt.Cdr L Iselin  ), and [[Frigate#Modern Age|frigate]] {{USS|Moberly|PF-63|6}} (Lt.Cdr Tollaksen CG, ). ''Ericsson'' was transiting the [[Cape Cod Canal]] with McCune on board when the summons came, so the remaining four ships headed for ''Kamen's'' location, with Tollaksen in temporary command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiCarpio |first1=Ralph |title=The Battle of Point Judith |url=http://www.desausa.org/de_photo_library/battle_of_point_judith.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030501030931/http://www.desausa.org/de_photo_library/battle_of_point_judith.htm |url-status=live |archive-date=1 May 2003 |website=Destroyer Escort Sailors Association |accessdate=29 March 2015 |ref=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had been en route to [[Boston]] after escorting Convoy GUS 84 to New York. With the news of the sinking, they were immediately ordered to start a search and destroy mission against the submarine. 

When the first ships arrived at point Judith at 19.30, they began sweeping the area with their late-war [[Sonar]] equipment. ''U-853'' was discovered bottomed in {{convert|108|ft|m|abbr=on}} of water just after midnight. After the warships had made their first attack, oil was sighted on the surface sparking the first series of claims that the U-boat had been destroyed. However, the ships continued to find contacts, so the attacks continued. McCune resumed overall command when ''Ericsson'' arrived in the early hours of the morning. ''Amick'' was detached  to make a pre-arranged rendezvous, and reinforcements arrived later, comprising the destroyers ''Barney'', ''Breckinridge'', and ''Blakeley'', the frigate ''Newport'', the corvettes ''Action'' and ''Restless'', and the auxiliary destroyer ''Semmes''.  These took up position around the search site to guard against the U-boat slipping past the attackers.

Attacks continued through the night. At 0530, oil, planking, life rafts, a chart tabletop, clothing, and an officer's cap were spotted on the surface. Nevertheless, destruction of ''U-853'' was not accepted by the command of the 1st Naval District in Boston so the hunt continued. By daybreak, the [[K class blimp|K class]] [[blimp]]s ''K-16'' and ''K-58'' from [[Lakehurst, New Jersey|Lakehurst]], [[New Jersey]] joined the attack, locating oil slicks and marking suspected locations with smoke and dye markers. ''K-16'' also attacked with six {{convert|7.2|in|mm|abbr=on}} rocket bombs. Finally at 1207 Eastern Sea Frontier in New York accepted the destruction of the U-boat and the hunt was ended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.armed-guard.com/ag2.html armed-guard.com SS Black Point]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wreck==
Later that day, US Navy divers from {{USS|Penguin|ASR-12|6}} located the wreck of ''U-853'' at a depth of {{convert|40|m|abbr=on}}. Battle damage consisted of two hits to the submarine's pressure hull resulting in the death of all its 55-man crew. Evidence showed the ''U-853'' had been destroyed at some point between midnight and mid-day on 6 May. During the 17-hour hunt, the warships from TF60.7 had expended 264 [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog bombs]] and 95 [[depth charge]]s; at least one ship was damaged by the concussion from the ordnance exploding in shallow waters. Many of the later attacks made by TF60.7 were so-called "tin-opener attacks" against the U-boat wreck in order to gain evidence of its destruction.
