The '''New Guinea campaign''' of the [[Pacific War]] lasted from January 1942 until the end of the war in August 1945. During the initial phase in early 1942, the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded the [[Australia]]n-administered Mandated [[Territory of New Guinea]] (23 January) and [[Territory of Papua|the Australian Territory of Papua]] (21 July) and overran [[Dutch New Guinea|western New Guinea]] (beginning 29/30 March), which was a part of the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. During the second phase, lasting from late 1942 until the Japanese surrender, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]—consisting primarily of Australian and US forces—cleared the Japanese first from Papua, then the Mandate and finally from the Dutch colony.

The campaign resulted in a crushing defeat and heavy losses for the Empire of Japan. As in most Pacific War campaigns, disease and starvation claimed more Japanese lives than enemy action. Most Japanese troops never even came into contact with Allied forces, and were instead simply cut off and subjected to an effective blockade by the US Navy. Garrisons were effectively besieged and denied shipments of food and medical supplies, and as a result, some claim that 97% of Japanese deaths in this campaign were from non-combat causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/journal/j34/stevens.asp#23 |author=Stevens, David |title=The Naval Campaigns for New Guinea |page=paragraph 30 |journal=Journal of the Australian War Memorial  |accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John Laffin]], the campaign "was arguably the most arduous fought by any Allied troops during World War II".&lt;ref&gt;Laffin 1986, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

==1942==
===Strategic situation===
[[File:Eastern New Guinea and New Britain 1944.jpg|thumb|480px|Papua New Guinea, the Bismarcks and the Northern Solomons]]
The struggle for New Guinea began with the [[Battle of Rabaul (1942)|capture by the Japanese]] of the city of [[Rabaul]] at the northeastern tip of [[New Britain Island]] in January 1942 (the Allies responded with multiple [[Bombing of Rabaul (1942)|bombing raids]], of which the [[Action off Bougainville]] was one). Rabaul overlooks [[Simpson Harbor]], a considerable natural anchorage, and was ideal for the construction of airfields.&lt;ref&gt;Rottman 2002, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keogh 1965, pp. 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next year, the Japanese built up the area into a major air and naval base.&lt;ref&gt;Rottman 2005, pp. 8 &amp; 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese [[Japanese Eighth Area Army|8th Area Army]] (equivalent to an Anglo-American army), under General [[Hitoshi Imamura]] at Rabaul, was responsible for both the New Guinea and [[Solomon Islands campaign]]s. The [[Japanese Eighteenth Army|Japanese 18th Army]] (equivalent to a Anglo-American corps), under Lieutenant General [[Hatazō Adachi]], was responsible for Japanese operations on mainland New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;Rottman 2005, pp. 12 &amp; 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonial capital of [[Port Moresby]] on the south coast of Papua was the strategic key for the Japanese in this area of operations. Capturing it would both neutralize the Allies' principal forward base and serve as a springboard for a [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|possible invasion of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1949, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reasons, General [[Douglas MacArthur]], Supreme Commander Allied Forces [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]] was determined to hold it. MacArthur was further determined to conquer all of New Guinea in his progress toward the eventual recapture of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 31–33&lt;/ref&gt; General Headquarters [[South West Pacific Area (command)|Southwest Pacific Area]] Operational Instruction No.7 of 25 May 1942, issued by Commander-Allied-Forces, General [[Douglas MacArthur]], placed all Australian and US Army, Air Force and Navy Forces in the Port Moresby Area under the control of [[New Guinea Force]].&lt;ref&gt;GHQ SWPA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese seizure of Lae and Salamaua===
{{Main|Invasion of Lae-Salamaua}}
Due north of Port Moresby, on the northeast coast of Papua, are the [[Huon Gulf]] and the [[Huon Peninsula]]. The Japanese entered [[Invasion of Lae-Salamaua|Lae and Salamaua]], two locations on Huon Gulf, on 8 March 1942 unopposed.&lt;ref name="Morison 1950, p. 31"&gt;Morison 1950, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; MacArthur would have liked to deny this area to the Japanese, but he had neither sufficient air nor naval forces to undertake a counterlanding. The Japanese at Rabaul and other bases on New Britain would have easily overwhelmed any such effort (by mid-September, MacArthur's entire naval force under Vice Admiral [[Arthur S. Carpender]] consisted entirely of 5 cruisers, 8 destroyers, 20 submarines, and 7 small craft).&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; The only Allied response was a bombing raid of [[Invasion of Lae-Salamaua|Lae and Salamaua]] by aircraft flying over the [[Owen Stanley Range]] from the carriers {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}} and {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|6}}, leading the Japanese to reinforce these sites.&lt;ref name="Morison 1950, p. 31"/&gt;

===Japanese attempt on Port Moresby===
{{main|Operation Mo}}
Operation Mo was the designation given by the Japanese to their initial plan to take possession of Port Moresby. Their operation plan decreed a five-pronged attack: one task force to establish a seaplane base at Tulagi in the lower Solomons, one to establish a seaplane base in the [[Louisiade Archipelago]] off the eastern tip of New Guinea, one of transports to land troops near Port Moresby, one with a [[Light aircraft carrier|light carrier]] to cover the landing, and one with two [[fleet carrier]]s to sink the Allied forces sent in response.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1949, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; In the resulting 4–8 May 1942 [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], the Allies suffered higher losses in ships, but achieved a crucial strategic victory by turning the Japanese landing force back, thereby removing the threat to Port Moresby, at least for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1949, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

After this failure, the Japanese decided on a longer term, two-pronged assault for their next attempt on Port Moresby. Forward positions would first be established at [[Milne Bay]], located in the forked eastern end of the Papuan peninsula, and at [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]], a village on the northeast coast of Papua about halfway between [[Huon Gulf]] and Milne Bay. Simultaneous operations from these two locations, one amphibious and one overland, would converge on the target city.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crossing the Owen Stanleys===
{{Main|Kokoda Track campaign}}

| source = – Samuel Eliot Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 34
}}

Buna was easily taken as the Allies had no military presence there (MacArthur wisely chose not to attempt an occupation by paratroopers since any such force would have been easily wiped out by the Japanese). The Japanese [[Invasion of Buna-Gona|occupied the village]] with an initial force of 1,500 on 21 July and by 22 August had 11,430 men under arms at Buna. Then began the grueling [[Kokoda Track campaign]], a brutal experience for both the Japanese and Australian troops involved. On 17 September, the Japanese had reached the village of Ioribaiwa, just {{convert|30|km|-1}} from the Allied airdrome at Port Moresby. The Australians held firm and began their counterdrive on 26 September. According to Morison, "...the Japanese retreat down the Kokoda Trail had turned into a rout. Thousands perished from starvation and disease; the commanding general, [[Tomitarō Horii|Horii]], was drowned."&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Thus was the overland threat to Port Moresby permanently removed.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air operations===
Since Port Moresby was the only port supporting operations in Papua, its defence was critical to the campaign. The air defences consisted of [[Bell P-39 Airacobra|P-39]] and [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40]] fighters. RAAF [[radar]] could not provide sufficient warning of Japanese attacks, so reliance was placed on [[coastwatchers]] and spotters in the hills until an American radar unit arrived in September with better equipment.&lt;ref name= "Craven477"&gt;Craven &amp; Cate 1948, pp. 476–477.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese bombers were often escorted by fighters which came in at {{convert|30000|ft|m|abbr=on}}—too high to be intercepted by the P-39s and P-40s—giving the Japanese an altitude advantage in air combat.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1944, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost to the Allied fighters was high. Before June, between 20 and 25 P-39s had been lost in air combat, while three more had been destroyed on the ground and eight had been destroyed in landings by accident. The following month at least 20 fighters were lost in combat, while eight were destroyed in July.&lt;ref&gt;Craven &amp; Cate 1948, p. 477 &amp; 723 (note 15)&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian and American anti-aircraft gunners of the Composite Anti-Aircraft Defences played a crucial part. The gunners got a lot of practice; Port Moresby suffered its 78th raid on 17 August 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1944, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; A gradual improvement in their numbers and skill forced the Japanese bombers up to higher altitude, where they were less accurate, and then, in August, to raiding by night.&lt;ref name="Craven477"/&gt;

Although RAAF [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBY Catalina]]s and [[Lockheed Hudson]]s were based at Port Moresby, because of the Japanese air attacks, long-range bombers like [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17s]], [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25]]s, and [[Martin B-26 Marauder|B-26]]s could not be safely based there and were instead staged through from bases in Australia. This resulted in considerable fatigue for the air crews. Due to USAAF doctrine and a lack of long-range escorts, long-range bomber raids on targets like Rabaul went in unescorted and suffered heavy losses, prompting severe criticism of [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George Brett (general)|George Brett]] by war correspondents for misusing his forces.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1944, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; But fighters did provide cover for the transports, and for bombers when their targets were within range.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1944, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Aircraft based at Port Moresby and Milne Bay fought to prevent the Japanese from basing aircraft at Buna, and attempted to prevent the Japanese reinforcement of the Buna area.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1944, pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Japanese ground forces pressed toward Port Moresby, the Allied Air Forces struck supply points along the Kokoda Track. Japanese makeshift bridges were attacked by P-40s with {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1944, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allied defence of Milne Bay===
{{Main|Battle of Milne Bay}}
{{quote box

| quote = "Thenceforth, the [[Battle of Milne Bay]] became an infantry struggle in the sopping jungle carried on mostly at night under pouring rain.

| source = – Samuel Eliot Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 38
}}

While it was beyond MacArthur's capabilities to deny Buna to the Japanese, the same could not be said of [[Milne Bay]], which was easily accessible by Allied naval forces. In early June, US Army engineers, Australian infantry and an anti-aircraft battery were landed near the [[Lever Brothers]] coconut plantation at [[Gili Gili]], and work was begun on an airfield. By 22 August, about 8,500 Australians and 1,300 Americans were on site.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese arrived and the 25 August – 7 September [[Battle of Milne Bay]] was underway. Historian Samuel Eliot Morison summed up the results this way:

{{quote|''...the enemy had shot his bolt; he never showed up again in these waters. The Battle for Milne Bay was a small one as World War II engagements went, but very important. Except for the initial assault on Wake Island, this was the first time that a Japanese amphibious operation had been thrown for a loss ... Furthermore, the Milne Bay affair demonstrated once again that an amphibious assault without air protection, and with an assault force inferior to that of the defenders, could not succeed.''&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[D'Entrecasteaux Islands]] lie directly off the northeast coast of the lower portion of the Papuan peninsula. The westernmost island of this group, [[Goodenough Island|Goodenough]], had been occupied in August 1942 by 353 stranded troops from bombed Japanese landing craft. The destroyer ''Yayoi'', sent to recover these men, was itself bombed and sunk on 11 September. A force of 800 Australian troops [[Battle of Goodenough Island|landed on 22 October]] on either side of the Japanese position. Beleaguered, the survivors of the Japanese garrison were evacuated by submarine on the night of 26 October. The Allies proceeded to turn the island into an air base.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allied recapture of Buna and Gona===

}}

The Japanese drive to conquer all of New Guinea had been decisively stopped. MacArthur was now determined to liberate the island as a stepping-stone to the reconquest of the Philippines. MacArthur's rollback began with the 16 November 1942 – 22 January 1943 [[Battle of Buna-Gona]]. The experience of the green [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|US 32nd Infantry Division]], just out of training camp and utterly unschooled in jungle warfare, was nearly disastrous. Instances were noted of officers completely out of their depth, of men eating meals when they should have been on the firing line, even of cowardice. MacArthur relieved the division commander and on 30 November instructed Lieutenant General [[Robert L. Eichelberger]], commander of the [[US I Corps]], to go to the front personally with the charge "to remove all officers who won't fight ... if necessary, put sergeants in charge of battalions ... I want you to take Buna, or not come back alive."&lt;ref&gt;Vader 1971, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

| width = 26em
}}

The [[7th Division (Australia)|Australian 7th Division]] under the command of Major General [[George Alan Vasey]], along with the revitalized US 32nd Division, restarted the Allied offensive. Gona fell to the Australians on 9 December 1942, Buna to the US 32nd on 2 January 1943, and [[Sanananda]], located between the two larger villages, fell to the Australians on 22 January.&lt;ref&gt;Vader 1971, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Operation Lilliput]] (18 December 1942 – June 1943) was an ongoing resupply operation ferrying troops and supplies from [[Milne Bay]], at the tip of the [[Papua New Guinea|Papuan Peninsula]], to [[Oro Bay]], a little more than halfway between Milne Bay and the [[Buna-Gona campaign|Buna–Gona]] area.&lt;ref&gt;Gill 1968, pp. 239, 262 &amp; 283&lt;/ref&gt;

==1943==
===Holding Wau===
{{Main|Battle of Wau}}
[[File:Deadjapanese.jpg|thumb|Two dead Japanese soldiers in a water filled shell hole somewhere in New Guinea]]
[[Wau, Papua New Guinea|Wau]] is a village in the interior of the Papuan peninsula, approximately {{convert|50|km|-1}} southwest of [[Salamaua]]. An airfield had been built there during an area gold rush in the 1920s and 1930s. This airfield was of great value to the Australians during the fighting for northeast Papua.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Japanese had decided to give up on [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal]], the capture of Port Moresby loomed even larger in their strategic thinking. Taking the airfield at Wau was a crucial step in this process, and to this end, the [[Japanese 51st Division|51st Division]] was transferred from Indochina and placed under General [[Hitoshi Imamura]]'s [[Japanese Eighth Area Army|Eighth Area Army]] at Rabaul; one regiment arrived at Lae in early January 1943. In addition, about 5,400 survivors of the Japanese defeat at [[Battle of Buna-Gona|Buna-Gona]] were moved into the Lae-Salamaua area. Opposing these forces were the Australian [[2/5th Battalion (Australia)|2/5th]], [[2/6th Battalion (Australia)|2/6th]] and [[2/7th Battalion (Australia)|2/7th Battalions]] along with Lieutenant Colonel Norman Fleay's [[Kanga Force]].&lt;ref&gt;Vader 1971, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australians decisively turned back the Japanese assault in the ensuing 29–31 January 1943 [[Battle of Wau]]. "Within a few days, the enemy was retreating from the Wau Valley, where he had suffered a serious defeat, harassed all the way back to Mubo..."&lt;ref&gt;Vader 1971, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; About one week later, the Japanese completed their [[Guadalcanal Campaign#Ke evacuation|evacuation of Guadalcanal]].&lt;ref&gt;Rottman 2005, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final Japanese drive on Wau===
{{Main|Battle of the Bismarck Sea}}
General Imamura and his naval counterpart at [[Rabaul]], Admiral [[Jinichi Kusaka]], commander [[Southeast Area Fleet]], resolved to reinforce their ground forces at [[Lae]] for one final all-out attempt against Wau. If the transports succeeded in staying behind a weather front and were protected the whole way by fighters from the various airfields surrounding the [[Bismarck Sea]], they might make it to Lae with an acceptable level of loss, i.e., at worst half the task force would be sunk en route.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; It is indicative of the extent to which Japanese ambitions had fallen at this point in the war that a 50% loss of ground troops aboard ship was considered acceptable.{{Cn|date=June 2020}}

[[File:A20BismarckSea.jpg|thumb|An Allied A-20 bomber attacks Japanese shipping during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, March, 1943]]

Three factors conspired to create disaster for the Japanese. First, they had woefully underestimated the strength of the Allied air forces. Second, the Allies had become convinced that the Japanese were preparing a major seaborne reinforcement and so had stepped up their air searches. Most important of all, the bombers of MacArthur's air forces, under the command of Lieutenant General [[George Kenney|George C. Kenney]], had been modified to enable new offensive tactics. Their noses had been refitted with eight 50-caliber machine guns for strafing slow-moving ships on the high seas. In addition, their bomb bays were filled with 500-pound bombs to be used in the newly devised practice of [[skip bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

About 6,900 troops aboard eight transports, escorted by eight destroyers, departed Rabaul at midnight 28 February under the command of Rear Admiral [[Masatomi Kimura]].&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Through the afternoon of 1 March, the overcast weather held at which point everything began to go wrong for the Japanese. The weather changed direction and Kimura's slow-moving task force was spotted by an Allied scout plane. By the time the Allied bombers and PT boats finished their work on 3 March, Kimura had lost all eight transports and four of his eight destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 58–62&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining destroyers with about 2,700 surviving troops limped back to Rabaul. According to Morison, the Japanese "...never again risked a transport larger than a small coaster or barge in waters shadowed by American planes. His contemplated offensive against Wau died a-borning."&lt;ref name="Morison 1950, p. 62"&gt;Morison 1950, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

For this, he ordered the air arm of Vice Admiral [[Jisaburo Ozawa|Jisaburo Ozawa's]] [[Third Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Third Fleet]] carriers to reinforce the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service#Eleventh Air Fleet and land-based air fleets|Eleventh Air Fleet]] at Rabaul. To demonstrate the seriousness of the effort to the Supreme War Council, multiple shifts of high-ranking personnel were also effected: Both Yamamoto and Ozawa moved their headquarters to Rabaul; and [[IJN 8th Fleet|Eighth Fleet]] commander Vice Admiral [[Gunichi Mikawa]] as well as General Imamura's chief of staff were sent to Tokyo with advice and explanations for the respective General Staffs (Admiral [[Tomoshige Samejima]] replaced Mikawa as Eight Fleet commander).&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;

I-Go was to be carried out in two phases, one against the lower Solomons and one against Papua.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

The first strike, on 7 April, was against Allied shipping in the [[Ironbottom Sound|waters between Guadalcanal and Tulagi]]. At 177 planes, this was the largest Japanese air attack since [[Pearl Harbor Attack|Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 120–123&lt;/ref&gt; Yamamoto then turned his attention to New Guinea: 94 planes struck [[Oro Bay]] on 11 April; 174 planes hit [[Port Moresby]] on 12 April; and in the largest raid of all, 188 aircraft struck [[Milne Bay]] on 14 April.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 125–126&lt;/ref&gt;

I-Go demonstrated that the Japanese command was not learning the lessons of air power that the Allies were. The Allied [[Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943)|reduction of Rabaul]] was only made possible by relentless air strikes that took place day after day, but Yamamoto thought the damage inflicted by a few attacks of large formations would derail Allied plans long enough for Japan to prepare a defense in depth. Also, Yamamoto accepted at face value his fliers' over-optimistic reports of damage: they reported a score of one cruiser, two destroyers and 25 transports, as well as 175 Allied planes, a figure that should certainly have aroused some skepticism. Actual Allied losses amounted to one destroyer, one oiler, one corvette, two cargo ships and approximately 25 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt; These meager results were not commensurate with either the resources expended or the expectations that had been promoted.{{Cn|date=June 2020}}

===Allied strategy toward Rabaul===
{{Main|Operation Cartwheel}}
The umbrella term for the series of strategic actions taken by the Allies to reduce and capture the vast Japanese naval and air facilities at [[Rabaul]] was [[Operation Cartwheel]]. Two major moves were planned for the end of June:
* Turner's III 'Phib undertook [[Operation Toenails]], the invasion of the [[New Georgia Islands]] halfway up the [[Solomon Islands|Solomons]] chain (30 June – 7 October 1943).
* Barbey's VII 'Phib carried out two almost simultaneous undertakings. [[Operation Chronicle]], the capture of the [[Trobriand Islands]] between Papua and the [[Solomon Islands|Solomons]] (22 – 30 June 1943), and the landing of a combined American/Australian force at [[Landing at Nassau Bay|Nassau Bay]] on the Papuan coast just south of [[Huon Gulf]] (30 June – 6 July 1943).&lt;ref&gt;Morison 1950, pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] realized that a landing and siege of "Fortress Rabaul" would be far too costly, and that the Allies' ultimate strategic purposes could be achieved by simply neutralizing and bypassing it. At the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943, the leaders of the Allied nations agreed to this change in strategy focusing on neutralizing Rabaul rather than capturing it.&lt;ref&gt;Office of the Combined Chiefs of Staff 1943, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
