'''Operation Rentier''' (''Reindeer'') was a German operation during [[World War II]] intended to secure the [[nickel]] mines around [[Territories ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union|Petsamo]] in [[Finland]], against a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] attack in the event of a renewed war between Finland and the Soviet Union.

The planning for the operation started on 13 August 1940, after the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|German occupation of Norway]] was complete, and was finalized in October that year. The plan called for the two divisions of the [[Alpine Corps Norway (Germany)|Alpine Corps Norwegen]] to occupy Petsamo and prevent Soviet capture of strategically important mines.

The operation was carried out by the [[Wehrmacht]] as part of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German attack on the Soviet Union. The operation commenced on 22 June 1941; the [[2nd Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Mountain Division]] occupied the area around [[Liinakhamari]] and the [[3rd Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|3rd Mountain Division]] occupied [[Luostari]]. The operation was followed up by [[Operation Platinum Fox]], which was an attack by the two divisions against [[Murmansk]] as a part of the larger [[Operation Silver Fox]].
