The Battle of the Bzura took place to the west of [[Warsaw]], near the [[Bzura River]].  A Polish breakout [[Offensive (military)|attack]] gained initial success but eventually faltered after a concentrated German counterattack.

== Background ==
[[File:Poland1939 GermanPlanMap.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Dispositions of opposing forces, 31 August 1939, and the German plan.]]
[[File:Poland2.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Map showing the Polish assault southwards]]

The Polish plan for defense against the German invasion, [[Plan West]], called for the [[Battle of the Border|defense of the borders]].&lt;ref name=seidner&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. ''Marshal Edward Śmigły-Rydz Rydz....'',34-128.&lt;/ref&gt; This was dictated more by political than military concerns, as Poles feared that the Germans, after taking over territories they lost in the [[Treaty of Versailles]], would try to end the war and keep those territories.&lt;ref name=ciszal4/&gt; While defending the borders was riskier, the Poles were counting on the British and French counteroffensive ([[Western betrayal|that never came]]).&lt;ref name=ciszal4/&gt; Due to this, [[Army Pomorze]] under general [[Władysław Bortnowski]] found itself in the [[Polish Corridor]], surrounded by German forces on two fronts, and [[Army Poznań]] under general [[Tadeusz Kutrzeba]] was pushed to the westernmost fringes of the Second Polish Republic, separated both from its primary defensive positions, and from other Polish Armies.&lt;ref name=ciszal4/&gt;

The German offensive proved the folly of the border defense plan in the first days of the war.&lt;ref name=ciszal5&gt;Cisowski, Zalewski, ''Bitwa...'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Army Pomorze was defeated in the [[battle of Bory Tucholskie]], and forced to retreat towards the south-east.&lt;ref name=ciszal5/&gt; Army Poznań, meanwhile, although not facing heavy German assaults, was forced to retreat east due to defeats of its neighbours (Army Pomorze in the north and [[Army Łódź]] in the south); both of them were retreating, meaning that Army Poznań was in danger of being flanked and surrounded by the German forces.&lt;ref name=ciszal5/&gt; On 4 September, Army Poznań moved through [[Poznań]] and abandoned it to the enemy, although at this point it was not in contact with any significant German forces.&lt;ref name=ciszal5/&gt; By 6 September, Armies Pomorze and Poznań had linked, forming the strongest Polish operational unit in the campaign, and general Bortkowski accepted the command of general Kutrzeba.&lt;ref name=ciszal5/&gt;

On 7 September, Polish forces became aware of the German push towards [[Łęczyca]], which if successful could cut off the retreat route of Polish forces.&lt;ref name=ciszal5/&gt; By 8 September, advanced German troops reached [[Warsaw]], marking the beginning of the [[siege of Warsaw (1939)|1939 siege of Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=ciszal5/&gt; At the same time, German forces had lost contact with Army Poznań, and German command assumed that the army must have been transported by rail to aid Warsaw's defense; they were unaware that in fact Army Poznań had merged forces with Army Pomorze, which they considered, since its defeat at Bory Tucholskie, no longer a significant threat.&lt;ref name=ciszal5/&gt; On 8 September the Germans were certain that they had eliminated major Polish resistance west of Vistula and were preparing to cross it and engage the Polish forces on the other side.&lt;ref name=cbapl&gt;{{cite web|title=Wojna Światowa|work=Historia Polski|accessdate=2008-08-24|url=http://historia.cba.pl/drugawojna/bzura.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071231125414/http://historia.cba.pl/drugawojna/bzura.php |archivedate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, general Kutrzeba and his staff officers had suspected, even before the German invasion, that it would be the neighbouring Armies that would bear the German attack, and had developed plans at an offensive towards the south, to relieve Army Łódź.&lt;ref name=ciszal6&gt;Cisowski, Zalewski, ''Bitwa...'', p.6&lt;/ref&gt; In the first week of the campaign, those plans, however, were rejected by the Polish commander-in-chief, Marshal [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]].&lt;ref name=ciszal6/&gt; By 8 September Kutrzeba had lost contact with Rydz-Śmigły, who had relocated his command center from Warsaw to [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]]; due to these factors, Kutrzeba decided to go forward with his plan.&lt;ref name=ciszal6/&gt; His situation was dire, as German forces were close to surrounding his units: the [[8th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 8th Army]] had secured the southern bank of the [[Bzura]] river and the [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 4th Army]] had secured the northern bank of [[Vistula]], from [[Włocławek]] to [[Wyszogród]], and its elements were attacking the rear of the Armies Pomorze and Poznań from the direction of [[Inowrocław]] and crossing the [[Vistula]] river near [[Płock]].&lt;ref name=ciszal6/&gt;

== Opposing forces ==
Polish forces consisted of [[Army Poznań]] and [[Army Pomorze]].&lt;ref name=ciszal4/&gt; German forces included the [[8th Army (Wehrmacht)|8th Army]] under [[Johannes Blaskowitz]] and [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|10th Army]] under [[Walther von Reichenau]] of [[Army Group South|Army Group South (''Heeresgruppe Süd'')]], elements of the [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th Army]] under [[Günther von Kluge]] of the [[Army Group North|Army Group North (''Heeresgruppe Nord'')]] and air support ([[Luftflotte 1]] and [[Luftflotte 4]]).&lt;ref name=ciszal4/&gt;

== Battle ==
The battle can be divided into 3 phases:
* Phase I — Polish [[offensive (military)|offensive]] towards [[Stryków]], aiming at the flank of the German 10th Army (9–12 September)&lt;ref name=ciszal4/&gt;
* Phase II — Polish offensive towards [[Łowicz]] (13–15 September)&lt;ref name=ciszal4/&gt;
* Phase III — German counterattack and eventual defeat of the Poles, with the latter's [[withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]] towards [[Warsaw]] and 
[[Modlin (Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki)|Modlin]] (16–19 September)&lt;ref name=ciszal4/&gt;
[[File:Bitwa bzura 13-09-39.png|thumbnail|left|Map of the first phase by [[c:User:Lonio17|Lonio17]]]]

On the night of 9 September, the Polish [[Poznań Army]] commenced a counterattack from the south of the [[Bzura|Bzura river]], its target being the German forces from the 8th Army advancing between [[Łęczyca]] and [[Łowicz]], towards [[Stryków]].&lt;ref name=ciszal8&gt;Cisowski, Zalewski, ''Bitwa...'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ciszal11&gt;Cisowski, Zalewski, ''Bitwa...'', p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The commander of [[Poznań Army]], [[Tadeusz Kutrzeba]] noticed that the German [[8th Army (Wehrmacht)|8th Army]], commanded by general [[Johannes Blaskowitz]], was weakly secured from the north by only the [[30th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|30th Infantry Division]] stretched over a 30 kilometre defensive line while the rest of the army was advancing towards Warsaw. The main thrust of the Polish offensive were the units under general [[Edmund Knoll-Kownacki]], known as the Knoll-Kownacki [[Operational Group]] (Polish [[14th Infantry Division (Poland)|14th]], [[17th Infantry Division (Poland)|17th]], [[25th Infantry Division (Poland)|25th]] and [[26th Infantry Division (Poland)|26th Infantry Divisions]]).&lt;ref name=ciszal8/&gt;&lt;ref name=ciszal11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. ''Marshal Edward Śmigły-Rydz Rydz....'', 120-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The right wing of the offensive, in the area [[Łęczyce]], included the [[Podolska Cavalry Brigade]] under Col. L. Strzelecki, and on the left, advancing from [[Łowicz]] to the area of [[Głowno]], the [[Wielkopolska Cavalry Brigade]] under general [[Roman Abraham]].&lt;ref name=ciszal8/&gt;&lt;ref name=ciszal11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. ''Marshal Edward Śmigły-Rydz Rydz....'',124.&lt;/ref&gt; These groups inflicted considerable losses on the German defenders from the 30th Infantry Division and the [[24th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|24th Infantry Division]], with some 1,500 German soldiers killed or wounded and an additional 3,000 lost as prisoners during the initial push.&lt;ref name=ciszal8/&gt;&lt;ref name=ciszal11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elble Rolf, 1975, ''Die Schlacht an der Bzura im September 1939 aus deutscher und polnischer Sicht''&lt;/ref&gt; The cavalry brigades supplemented with [[TKS]] and [[TKS|TK-3]] reconnaissance tanks moved to threaten the flanks and rear of the advancing German units.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. ''Marshal Edward Śmigły-Rydz Rydz....'',124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German forces were thrown back approximately 20 kilometres and the Poles recaptured several towns, including [[Łęczyca]] and [[Piątek]], and the village of [[Góra Świętej Małgorzaty]].&lt;ref name=ciszal8/&gt; On 10 September, the [[Polish 17th Infantry Division]] met the [[17th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|German 17th Infantry Division]] at Małachowicze. The following day Polish forces continued their attack, advancing on [[Modlna]], [[Pludwiny]], [[Osse, Łódź Voivodeship|Osse]] and [[Głowno]].&lt;ref name=ciszal8/&gt;

Initially underestimating the Polish advance, the Germans decided on 11 September to redirect the main force of the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]], the [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 4th Army]], the reserves of the [[Army Group South]], and aircraft from 4th Air Fleet towards the Bzura. These forces included the [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|German 1st Panzer Division]], [[4th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|German 4th Panzer Division]] and the newly formed SS Infantry regiment [[1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler#Invasion of Poland|Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref name=ciszal9&gt;Cisowski, Zalewski, ''Bitwa...'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; German air superiority had a significant impact, making it very costly and difficult for the Poles to move units during the day.&lt;ref name=ciszal11/&gt; The following day the Poles reached the line Stryków-[[Ozorków]]. That day General [[Tadeusz Kutrzeba]] learned that units of [[Army Łódź]] had retreated to the [[Modlin Fortress]], and decided to stop the offensive, instead looking to try to break through [[Sochaczew]] and the [[Kampinos Forest]] to reach [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=ciszal11/&gt;&lt;ref name=ciszal9/&gt;

On the morning of 14 September, General [[Władysław Bortnowski]]'s [[Polish 26th Infantry Division|26th]] and [[Polish 16th Infantry Division|16th Infantry Divisions]] crossed the Bzura near Łowicz.  The [[Polish 4th Infantry Division]] reached the road linking Łowicz with Głowno.  At this point however, Bortnowski ordered the 26th Infantry Division to retreat. He had learned of the withdrawal of the [[4th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|German 4th Panzer Division]] from the outskirts of Warsaw, and was concerned that this Panzer division posed a threat to his men.&lt;ref name=ciszal9/&gt;

On 15 and 16 September, Army Pomorze took up defensive positions on the north bank of the Bzura. General [[Stanisław Grzmot-Skotnicki]]'s group was between [[Kutno]] and [[Żychlin]], General [[Michał Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski]]'s units near [[Gąbin]], and parts of Army Poznań by the Bzura near [[Sochaczew]], were ready to begin their drive towards Warsaw. To encircle and destroy the Polish forces, the Germans used most of their 10th Army, including two armoured, one motorized, and three light divisions, equipped with some 800 tanks altogether. The attack from all sides on Polish positions started on 16 September, with the support of the [[Luftwaffe]]. On 15 September Poles were forced out of [[Sochaczew]], a town on the Bzura river, and trapped in a triangle of Bzura, Vistula and German forces.&lt;ref name=ciszal11/&gt;&lt;ref name=ciszal10&gt;Cisowski, Zalewski, ''Bitwa...'', p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|German 1st Panzer Division]], after crossing the Bzura between Sochaczew and [[Brochów]] and engaging the Polish 25th Infantry Division managed to capture [[Ruszki, Masovian Voivodeship|Ruszki]], but its advance was then halted. Poles began to cross the Bzura near the Vistula, north of Sochaczew, and retreat towards Warsaw.&lt;ref name=ciszal11/&gt;&lt;ref name=ciszal10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. ''Marshal Edward Śmigły-Rydz Rydz....'',127.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish forces were forced to abandon most of their heavy equipment while crossing the river.&lt;ref name=ciszal10/&gt; On 17 September, German heavy artillery was shelling the crossing north of Brochów, and the largest air operation of the campaign began, with the Luftwaffe attacking the retreating Polish forces.&lt;ref name=ciszal11/&gt;&lt;ref name=ciszal10/&gt;

During the night of 17 September, the main forces of Army Poznań attacked the German forces in order to break out of the German encirclement between [[Witkowice, Masovian Voivodeship|Witkowice]] and Sochaczew. The 15th Infantry Division and Podolska Cavalry Brigade again crossed the Bzura in Witkowice. In Brochow, the 25th and 17th Infantry Divisions crossed the Bzura river. The 14th Infantry Division was concentrated in [[Łaziska, Sochaczew County|Łaziska]]. At the same time, Army Pomorze marched towards the villages of [[Osmolin]], [[Kierozia]] and [[Osiek, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship|Osiek]].

In the morning the Germans started their drive towards the south along both banks of the Bzura, supported by more than 300 aircraft and heavy artillery.&lt;ref name=ciszal10/&gt; German [[howitzer]]s, taking advantage of their position on the high ground of the [[Vistula]]'s right bank, shelled Polish positions for the entire day.&lt;ref name=ciszal10/&gt; And after two days of heavy fighting, with no ammunition or food rations remaining, further attempts at a breakout for the Poles became impossible.&lt;ref name="seidner"/&gt;

Only a few Polish units managed to break out of the encirclement.&lt;ref name=ciszal10/&gt; These groups entered [[Warsaw]] and Modlin, mostly around 19 and 20 September, crossing the Kampinos Forest, and fighting German units in the area (for example, in the [[battle of Wólka Węglowa]]).&lt;ref name=ciszal11/&gt;&lt;ref name=ciszal1213&gt;Cisowski, Zalewski, ''Bitwa...'', pp.12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were Generals Kutrzeba, Knoll-Kowacki and Tokarzewski, two cavalry brigades (Wielkopolska and Podolska) of General Abraham, and the 15th and 25th Infantry Divisions. The remainder (4th, 14th, 17th, 26th and 27th Infantry Divisions), which didn't manage to cross the river, with General Bortnowski, capitulated between 18 and 22 September.&lt;ref name=cbapl/&gt;&lt;ref name=ciszal11/&gt; Polish casualties were estimated at 20,000 dead, including three generals: [[Franciszek Wład]], [[Stanisław Grzmot-Skotnicki]] and [[Mikołaj Bołtuć]].&lt;ref name=ciszal4/&gt; German casualties are estimated at 8,000 dead.&lt;ref name=cbapl/&gt;

After the battle the remaining German divisions rushed towards Warsaw and Modlin and soon encircled both. The Bzura campaign ended in defeat for the Poles but because of the initial Polish local successes the German advance on Warsaw was halted for several days. The Wehrmacht was required to divert units from its push towards Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. ''Marshal Edward Śmigły-Rydz Rydz....'',128.&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled the Polish units defending Warsaw and its environs to better organize their own long-term, but ultimately failed, defense of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. ''Marshal Edward Śmigły-Rydz Rydz....'',128-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign also showed the importance of taking initiative, proved that horse cavalry units were still an important factor on the battlefield, and proved the importance of air superiority as well as confirmed that simple numerical superiority did still matter.&lt;ref name=ciszal4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrzej Kunert]] in "Wrzesień 1939 9/19 - Bzura" claims that at least one pivotal attack was cancelled because, while marching, the soldiers were asleep because they have not slept for a few days. This led to the loss of momentum. URL:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5QLw_zyMgo .&lt;/ref&gt;
