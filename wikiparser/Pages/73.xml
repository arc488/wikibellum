{{Campaignbox Mediterranean Campaign}}
The '''Battle of Skerki Bank''' was a [[World War II]] [[naval battle]] which took place near [[Skerki Bank]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on the early hours of 2 December 1942 between [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian]] forces and was the last major naval battle in the Mediterranean during 1942.

== Background ==
The British force consisted of the [[light cruiser]]s {{HMS|Aurora|12|6}}, {{HMS|Argonaut|61|2}} and {{HMS|Sirius|82|2}} with the destroyers {{HMS|Quentin|G78|6}} and {{HMAS|Quiberon|G81|6}}. The squadron was under the command of [[Rear Admiral]] [[C. H. J. Harcourt]]. 

On the night of 2 December, they found and attacked an Italian convoy and its escort bound for Tunisia. The convoy consisted of three destroyers and two [[torpedo boat]]s: the German ''KT-1'' (850 tons), ''Aventino'' (3,794 t), ''Puccini'' (2,422 t), and ''Aspromonte'' (an armed [[Ferry|ferry-boa]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t, 976 tons). The ships were carrying reinforcements for [[Erwin Rommel|General Rommel]]'s [[Africa Korps]]. It included 1,766 troops, 698 tons of cargo (mainly ammunition), 4 tanks, 32 other vehicles and 12 artillery pieces. The escort was composed of the destroyers {{ship|Italian destroyer|Nicoloso da Recco||2}} (flagship), ''[[Soldati-class destroyer|Camicia Nera]]'', ''[[Folgore-class destroyer|Folgore]]'' and the torpedo boats ''[[Spica-class torpedo boat|Clio]]'' and ''[[Orsa-class torpedo boat|Procione]]'' which were commanded by [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Aldo Cocchia]].

== Battle ==
The British ships opened fire and destroyed all the cargo and troop ships. The escort ships were hit as well, with ''Folgore'' fatally damaged (nine 133&amp;nbsp;mm direct hits) by cruisers, and later sunk with 120 dead (among them, commander Ener Bettica), ''Nicoloso da Recco'' badly damaged (an explosion of the forward 120&amp;nbsp;mm ammunition magazines put her out of commission until June 1943) with 118 dead. ''Camicia Nera'' launched all her 6 torpedoes, which missed their targets. HMS ''Sirius'' escaped with no damage despite ''Camicia Nera'' firing on her from only {{convert|2|km}}, dodging several torpedoes and continued cooperating in the sinking of the Axis convoy.

== Aftermath ==
At dawn, the short-range engagement saw a clear British victory, while the Axis suffered no fewer than 2,000 casualties (probably 2,037 or even 2,200, the total is uncertain) {{citation needed|date=December 2015}} and lost five ships, with ''Puccini'' still afloat, but to later sink. Whilst they were withdrawing [[SIAI-Marchetti|Savoias]] attacked Q-Force, without result but losing some aircraft. [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] claimed four [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79|Sparvieros]] with one loss, while HMS ''Quentin'' was sunk with 20 dead by a 500&amp;nbsp;kg bomb released from a [[Junkers  Ju 88]] (the hit scored may have been a torpedo). On the other side, the human losses were 124 from ''Folgore'', 118 from ''Nicoloso da Recco'', 39 from ''Aspromonte'', 3 from ''Procione'', 200 civil/militarized crew and 1,527 troops, all in ''Aventino'' and ''Puccini''.&lt;ref&gt;Sgarlato, Nico: Lo scontro del banco di Skerki, Eserciti nella Storia magazine, Delta editions, Parma, gen-feb-2012, p.23-25&lt;/ref&gt;
