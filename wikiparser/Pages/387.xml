'''Operation Doppelkopf''' ({{lang-de|Unternehmen Doppelkopf}}) and the following '''Operation Cäsar''' were [[Nazi Germany|German]] counter-offensives on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in the late summer of 1944 in the aftermath of the major Soviet advance in [[Operation Bagration]] with the aim of restoring a coherent front between Army Group North and Army Group Centre. The operation's codename was a reference to the German card game ''[[Doppelkopf]]''.

==Strategic situation==
By the end of July 1944, Soviet mechanised forces had reached the [[Gulf of Riga]] following their headlong advance in the [[Kaunas Offensive Operation|Kaunas]] and [[Šiauliai Offensive]]s, part of the third and final 'pursuit' phase of the strategic offensive [[Operation Bagration]].{{sfn|Ziemke|2002|p=403}} The Soviet [[2nd Guards Army (Soviet Union)|2nd Guards Army]] had exploited a breach between the German [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|Sixteenth Army]] of [[Army Group North]] and the neighbouring [[3rd Panzer Army|Third Panzer Army]] of [[Army Group Centre]], and severed the connection between them. German counter-attacks failed to restore it, and significant elements of the German armed forces were left isolated.

The ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' made immediate plans for an offensive to restore the connection between the two Army Groups.

==Planning==
A number of armoured formations were assembled under Army Group Centre in [[Courland]] with orders to attack towards Jelgava ({{lang-de|Mitau}}), cutting off the Soviet spearheads. The XXXX Panzer Corps, with the [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th]] and [[14th Panzer Division|14th]] Panzer Divisions, the [[Grossdeutschland Division]] and the [[1st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Infantry Division]], was assembled at [[Liepāja]] / Libau, while the XXXIX Panzer Corps was assembled at [[Tauragė|Tauroggen]].{{sfn|Mitcham|2007|p=140}}

==Deployments==
===''Wehrmacht''===
* [[Army Group Centre]] (Colonel-General [[Georg-Hans Reinhardt]]) (from 16 August)
** [[3rd Panzer Army|Third Panzer Army]] (General [[Erhard Raus]]) (from 16 August)
*** [[XL Panzer Corps (Germany)|XL Panzer Corps]] (General [[Otto von Knobelsdorff]])
*** [[XXXIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXIX Panzer Corps]] (General [[Dietrich von Saucken]])

===Red Army===
* Elements of [[3rd Belorussian Front]] (General [[Ivan Chernyakhovsky]])
* Elements of [[1st Baltic Front]] (General [[Hovhannes Bagramyan]])

==The offensive==
The operation commenced with an attack by the [[7th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|7th Panzer Division]] on 15 August towards [[Kelmė]]. The main offensive began the following day, but there was strong resistance against the XXXX Panzer Corps from ten Soviet infantry divisions supported by three artillery divisions and anti-tank units.{{sfn|Mitcham|2007|p=140}}

Von Saucken's XXXIX Panzer Corps opened operations on 18 August. Its left flank, an ''ad hoc'' formation under [[Hyacinth Graf Strachwitz von Groß-Zauche und Camminetz]], was preceded by a heavy artillery bombardment from the cruiser ''[[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|Prinz Eugen]]'';{{sfn|Ziemke|2002|p=343}} forces inside the pocket attacked to link up with Strachwitz's force. Strachwitz reached Sixteenth Army at [[Tukums]] by midday.{{sfn|Mitcham|2007|p=141}}

By 27 August, the corridor between Third Panzer Army and Sixteenth Army had been enlarged to 18 miles in width, though the latter had come under renewed pressure from a fresh Soviet offensive against [[Riga]].{{sfn|Mitcham|2007|p=143}} The operation had also failed in its more ambitious objectives of retaking [[Šiauliai]] or of cutting off the 6th Guards Army threatening Riga.

==Operation Cäsar==
A second German 'spoiling' attack, was planned to destroy Bagramyan's forces in the salient below Riga and push the front out to a straight line between the Segewold position and [[Šiauliai]].{{sfn|Ziemke|2002|p=406}} The main strike force was the reorganised XXXIX Panzer Corps, Third Panzer Army having been placed under the temporary overall control of Army Group North.{{sfn|Ziemke|2002|p=406}} The attack began on 16 September,{{sfn|Ziemke|2002|p=405}} in response to the Soviet [[Riga Offensive Operation]], but by 19 September it had ground to a halt in the face of intense Soviet resistance after having penetrated only a few miles.{{sfn|Ziemke|2002|p=406}} The German forces then assumed a defensive configuration.

==Aftermath==
The Red Army attacked again on 5 October, in the [[Memel Offensive Operation]].{{sfn|Ziemke|2002|p=407}} Five days later, they reached the Baltic Sea and finally cut off [[Army Group North]] in what eventually became the [[Courland Pocket]].{{sfn|Ziemke|2002|p=408}} The German [[XXVIII Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XXVIII Corps]] was isolated from the remainder of Third Panzer Army in a bridgehead at [[Klaipėda|Memel]].{{sfn|Ziemke|2002|p=408}}
