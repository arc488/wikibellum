The '''Battle of the Sea of Azov''', also known as the '''Chernigovka pocket''' was an Axis military campaign fought between 26 September 1941 and 11 October 1941 on the northern shores of the [[Sea of Azov]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] of [[World War II]] during [[Operation Barbarossa]]. It resulted in a complete Axis victory over the [[Red Army]].

After destroying five [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] armies at [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|Kiev]] in late September 1941, the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Army Group South]] advanced east and south to capture the industrial [[Donbass]] region and the [[Crimea]]. Within days of the battle of [[Kiev]]'s conclusion, the Soviet [[Southern Front (Soviet Union)|Southern Front]] launched an attack on 26 September with two armies on the northern shores of the Sea of Azov against elements of the German [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|11th Army]], which was simultaneously advancing into the Crimea. After initially pushing back the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]n [[Romanian 3rd Army|3rd Army]], which fought under German command, the Soviet advance ground to a halt when the [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Brigade]] arrived to reinforce their Axis allies. On 1 October the [[1st Panzer Army]] under [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Ewald von Kleist]] swept south to isolate the two Soviet armies. The offensive caught the Red Army completely by surprise, forcing them to retreat on 3 October to avoid [[pincer movement|encirclement]].

The Germans now attacked from the west, north and east, cutting the Soviets off on 7 October after capturing [[Melitopol]] and Berdiansk. The Soviet [[9th Army (Soviet Union)|9th]] and [[18th Army (Soviet Union)|18th Armies]] were caught in a vise and annihilated in four days. The Soviet defeat was total; 106,332 men captured, 212 [[tank]]s destroyed or captured in the pocket alone as well as 766 [[artillery]] pieces of all types. All units of the German 11th Army and the 1st Panzer Army lost 12,421 men combined from 21 September to 10 October; actual German losses in the battle were lower as only parts of both armies fought in the battle.{{sfn|Liedtke|2016|p=149}}

The death of or capture of two-thirds of all Southern Front troops in four days unhinged the Front's left flank, allowing the Germans to [[First Battle of Kharkov|capture]] [[Kharkiv]] on 24 October. Kleist's 1st Panzer Army took the Donbass region that same month, while Manstein's 11th Army was freed to [[Crimean Campaign|conquer Crimea]] with its full strength from 18 October onward.

==The battle==
After concluding the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|Battle of Kiev]] in September 1941, the German Army Group South advanced from the [[Dniepr River|Dniepr]] to the [[Sea of Azov]] coast. The city of Rostov was assigned as the objective for the [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|11th Army]] now commanded by General [[Eugen Ritter von Schobert|von Schobert]], however he died in a crash on the same day after landing his liaison [[Fieseler Fi 156|Fieseler Storch]] aircraft in a minefield. To replace him, General of Infantry [[Erich von Manstein|von Manstein]] was ordered to travel from the Leningrad sector of the front to the extreme southern sector. He would also receive support from the [[Luftflotte 4|4th Luftwaffe Air Fleet]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

At this time the [[LIV Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|LIV Army Corps]] of the 11th Army was still engaged in [[Crimea]], and because the Romanian forces were still engaged in the [[Siege of Odessa (1941)|Siege of Odessa]], the Army's resources for the Rostov objective were severely limited even against retreating Red Army troops. Therefore, initially von Manstein replaced the LIV Corps with the smaller [[XXX Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XXX Army Corps]] and [[XXXXIX Mountain Corps (Wehrmacht)|XLIX Mountain Corps]], and ordered the LIV Corps into the first echelon in the advance to Rostov.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Late in September the [[Romanian 3rd Army|3rd Romanian Army]] joined the 11th Army in its advance towards Rostov, but was severely depleted by the attacks of the Soviet [[9th Army (Soviet Union)|9th]] and [[18th Army (Soviet Union)|18th Armies]] on 26 September. This forced a halt to the Army's advance to safeguard its flank, and forced Manstein to use his only mobile reserve unit, the [[Leibstandarte#Brigade status.E2.80.94Balkans|Leibstandarte Brigade]] to shore up Romanian defenses.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Haupt, ''Army Group South: The Wehrmacht in Russia 1941-1945'', pp. 87-91&lt;/ref&gt;

After the LSSAH had stabilized the Romanian sector, the Soviets increased the pressure on XXX Army Corps. The Soviets did not respond to the buildup of the [[1st Panzer Army]] on their northern flank. On 1 October the Germans started their counterattack from the north and the west. The rapid advance of German armored and motorized forces from the north compelled the Soviets to retreat on 3 October. The 11th Army took up the pursuit, with the Leibstandarte's attack eliminating the Soviet [[30th Rifle Division]]'s HQ section and dispersing its subordinate formations. [[Melitopol]] was captured by [[III Panzer Corps]] on 5 October. The LSSAH reconnaissance battalion under [[Kurt Meyer]] captured [[Berdiansk]] on 6 October.  The [[XIV Panzer Corps|XIV motorized Army Corps]] under [[Gustav Anton von Wietersheim]] linked up with the Leibstandarte to encircle seven Red Army divisions in the [[Mariupol]]-Berdiansk area on 7 October. Four days later the battle was over and the 150,000 9th and 18th Army troops caught in the pocket had been killed or captured. The Germans took more than 106,332 prisoners, both in the pocket and during the pursuit, along with 212 tanks and 772 guns of all types. The 18th Army commander Smirnov was killed in action and buried with full military honours by the Germans.{{sfn|Liedtke|2016|p=149}}

==Aftermath==
===First Battle of Rostov===
The assault on Rostov began on 17 November, and on 21 November the Germans took Rostov. However, the German lines were over-extended, and von Kleist's warnings that his left flank was vulnerable and that his tanks were ineffective in the freezing weather were ignored. On 27 November the [[Soviet 37th Army]], commanded by Lieutenant-General [[Anton Ivanovich Lopatin]], as part of the [[Rostov Strategic Offensive Operation]] (17 November 1941 – 2 December 1941), counter-attacked the 1st Panzer Army's spearhead from the north, forcing them to pull out of the city. [[Adolf Hitler]] countermanded the retreat. When von Rundstedt refused to obey, Hitler sacked him, and replaced him with von Reichenau. However, von Reichenau saw at once that von Rundstedt was right and succeeded in persuading Hitler,  via [[Franz Halder]], to authorise the withdrawal,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Alan (1965). Barbarossa: The Russian-German Conflict 1941–45; p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1st Panzer Army was forced back to the [[Mius River]] at [[Taganrog]]. It was the first significant German withdrawal of the war.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

===Renewed offensive===
The offensive along the Azov coast was resumed in the summer of 1942, during ''[[Case Blue|Fall Blau]]''. With air support from the Ju 87s of ''[[Sturzkampfgeschwader 77]]'', [[Wilhelm List]]'s Army Group A recaptured Rostov, the "gate to the Caucasus", on 23 July 1942 relatively easily.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward (2001), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further South along the coast, the remaining small ports and coastal areas still in Soviet hands were captured by Romanian Cavalry. [[Yeysk]] fell to the Romanians on 8 August. The campaign came to an end on 23 August, when the Romanians captured the port of [[Temryuk]] after bitter house-to-house fighting against Soviet naval infantry. As Romanian troops entered the last Soviet-held Azov port, the main warships of the Soviet [[Azov Flotilla]] were scuttled to avoid capture: gunboats ''Bug'', ''Don'' and ''Dniester'' (each of 840 tons and armed with two 130&amp;nbsp;mm guns).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Forczyk, ''The Caucasus 1942–43: Kleist’s race for oil''&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Sea of Azov secured, the Axis proceeded to launch a massive amphibious operation (''Fall Blücher'') in a bid to wipe out Soviet resistance on the [[Taman Peninsula]] and open the sea route to the [[Crimea]].&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm H. Murfett, ''Naval Warfare 1919–45: An Operational History of the Volatile War at Sea'', p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;
