The town of [[Broome, Western Australia]], was attacked by Japanese fighter planes on 3 March 1942, during [[World War II]]. At least 88 civilians and Allied military personnel were killed.

Although Broome was a small [[mother of pearl|pearling]] port at the time, it was also a refuelling point for aircraft, on the route between the [[Dutch East Indies|Netherlands East Indies]] and [[List of Australian capital cities|major Australian cities]]. As a result, Broome was on a line of flight for [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and other refugees, following the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[Battle of Java (1942)|invasion of Java]], and had become a significant [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] military base. During a two-week period in February–March 1942, more than a thousand refugees from the Dutch East Indies—many of them in [[flying boat]]s, which often served as airliners at the time—passed through Broome.&lt;ref name="c7f.navy.mil"&gt;[http://www.c7f.navy.mil/news/2002/6/27.htm Lt (j.g.) Paul D. Petsu, 2002, "USS Sides pays tribute to Broome’s One Day War" ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050219203014/http://www.c7f.navy.mil/news/2002/6/27.htm |date=19 February 2005 }} (U.S. Seventh Fleet website.), accessed 18 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of refugees has previously been given as 8,000,&lt;ref name="c7f.navy.mil"/&gt; but new research by Dr Tom Lewis contends that this figure is massively overstated.  The figure was first quoted in the relevant Australian Official War History and has been reproduced in many publications since.&lt;ref name="Lewis2010"&gt;Lewis &amp; Ingman (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The actual number of aerial evacuees passing through Broome at this time is estimated to have been only 1,350. Most of these were military personnel. There were approximately 250 Dutch civilian refugees, most of whom were family members of Dutch aircrews.&lt;ref name="Lewis2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gillison, Douglas.

==The attack==
{{more citations needed section|date=March 2011}}
[[First Lieutenant|Lt]] [[Zenjiro Miyano]]—the commander of ''Dai 3 Kōkūtai'' (3rd Air Group) of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]]—led nine [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero]] [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]s and a [[Mitsubishi Ki-15|Mitsubishi C5M2]] [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance plane]] from their base at [[Kupang]], [[Timor]] in the attack, on the morning of 3 March.

From about 09:20, the Zeros made [[strafe|strafing]] attacks on the flying boat anchorage at [[Roebuck Bay]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) base at [[Broome International Airport|Broome Airfield]]. No bombs were dropped, although some were reported, perhaps a result of witnesses seeing the Zero pilots releasing their [[drop tank]]s. The raid lasted an hour.

The Japanese fighters destroyed at least 22 Allied aircraft. These included an airborne [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24A Liberator]], full of wounded personnel—nearly 20 died when it crashed in the sea, about {{convert|16|km|nmi mi|lk=on|abbr=on}} off Broome.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ozatwar.com/wa12.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies also lost 15 flying boats at anchorage; many Dutch refugees were on board and the exact number and identities of all those killed is unknown but the ages and names of some were recorded when they were moved from Broome to the Perth War Cemetery at Karrakatta in 1950 (the known casualties include 9 children, the youngest being just 1). At the airfield, the Japanese fighters destroyed two [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17E Flying Fortress]]es and a B-24 belonging to the USAAF, two [[Lockheed Hudson]]s belonging to the RAAF and a [[Lockheed Lodestar]] belonging to the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Air Force]] (ML-KNIL).

The aircraft destroyed included: eight [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBY Catalinas]] [[Consolidated PBY Catalina in Australian service|operated by the Royal Australian Air Force]], the [[Dutch Naval Aviation Service|Royal Netherlands Navy Air Service]] (MLD), [[United States Navy]] and the [[Royal Air Force]]; two [[Short Empire]]s belonging to the RAAF and [[QANTAS]], and five [[Dornier Do 24]]s belonging to the MLD.

A [[KLM]] [[Douglas DC-3]] airliner—[[PK-AFV]] (carrying refugees from [[Bandung]])—was also shot down, {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Broome, with the loss of four lives and diamonds worth [[Australian pound|£]]150,000 – 300,000 (now approximately [[Australian dollar|A$]]20–40 million).

There were no Allied fighter planes based in Broome at the time. The Zeroes encountered some light arms fire from the ground. One Zero pilot—Warrant Officer [[Osamu Kudō]]—was killed by ground fire from a Dutch ML-KNIL pilot, First Lieutenant [[Gus Winckel]], using a 7.9mm machine gun he had removed from his Lodestar. Winckel balanced the weapon on his shoulder and sustained burns to his left forearm when it touched the barrel of the gun after firing. Another Zero ran out of fuel and ditched while returning to his base, although the pilot survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Australian Geographic]] |title=WWII Broome air raid |url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/on-this-day/2015/03/on-this-day-in-history-broome-air-raids|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, new research argued instead that Kudo's Zero was shot down by the tail guns in the B-24A ''Arabian Knight'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pacificwrecks.com/aircraft/b-24/40-2370.html|title=Pacific Wrecks|last=PacificWrecks.com|access-date=2017-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which itself was downed by Kudo's attack with the loss of 19 of the 20 American military personnel on board.&lt;ref name="Lewis2010"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following the attack, an RAAF officer—[[Pilot Officer]] Frank Russell, who had been on one of the flying boats during the raid—wrote of
{{cquote| ... a scene of ghastly devastation! Our flying boats all over the place were sending up huge clouds of black smoke. Burning petrol in sinister patches floated all over the sea... All around us there fell a ceaseless stream of [[Tracer ammunition|tracer bullets]]. Several of the Dutch Dorniers had been full of women and kids, waiting to take off to ... safety. }}

Charlie D'Antoine—an [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] flying boat refueller—helped two passengers from the planes to reach the shore, swimming through burning fuel and wreckage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/message/tv/ms/s1548340.htm ABC-TV, "Broome Hero" (''Message Stick'', 5 February 2006)], accessed 18 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Antoine later received a bravery award from the Dutch government and was invited to attend a royal reception in the Netherlands.

At least one U.S. serviceman—Sgt. Melvin Donoho—managed to swim about {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the crashed B-24 to shore, a journey which took him more than 36 hours. Some accounts say that a Sgt. Willard J. Beatty also made it ashore but died soon afterwards; other sources suggest that this was a false report, emanating from one newspaper article.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/collections/maritime/march/treasures/zerohour/carnotbay.html#liberator Western Australian Museum (no date), "The B24 Liberator crash"], accessed 18 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese aircraft later made several smaller attacks on the Broome area. On 20 March, [[Mitsubishi G4M]]2 "Betty" [[medium bomber]]s made a high-altitude attack on the airfield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificwrecks.com/provinces/australia_broome.html pacificwrecks.com, 1997–2007, "Broome"] &amp; [http://www.awm.gov.au/alliesinadversity/japanese/broome.asp Australian War Museum, 2006, "The Japanese raid on Broome"], accessed 18 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; One civilian was killed and there was some crater damage. The last attack was in August 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vrb.gov.au/dvapublications/CLIK-darwin-42-45.pdf Veterans Review Board (no date), "Darwin"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828022016/http://www.vrb.gov.au/dvapublications/CLIK-darwin-42-45.pdf |date=28 August 2006 }}, accessed 18 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian journalist, broadcaster and author Coralie Clarke Rees&lt;ref&gt;Reece, Lesley, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/rees-coralie-clarke-11496 Coralie Clarke Rees], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography Online'', accessed 24 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; (1908–1972) published a less prosaic, and highly personal account of the Broome air raid in her 1946 elegy to her dead airman brother, ''Silent His Wings'':&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/silenthiswings00rees#page/8/mode/2up ''Silent His Wings,'' Internet Archive Open Library], accessed 8 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;You in a tiny hand-picked bunch of sappers
chosen to gelignite Broome in the teeth
of the down-swooping Jap, saw stately Dutch flying-boats,
lovely Dutch women, riddled with bullets, blasted, floating,
American Liberators and quaking Malays spine-shattered
by the hail of yellow bombs. You smelt and tasted death
and the tang of it never left your tongue.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
