'''Operation Excess''' was a series of [[United Kingdom|British]] supply convoys to [[Malta]], [[Alexandria]] and [[Greece]] in January 1941. The operation encountered the first presence of ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' anti-shipping aircraft in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. All the convoyed freighters reached their destinations. The destroyer ''Gallant'' was disabled by Italian mines and Axis bombers severely damaged the cruiser ''Southampton'' and the aircraft carrier ''Illustrious''.

==Background==
[[Italy]]'s declaration of War on 10 June 1940 brought the [[Second World War]] to the Mediterranean Sea and placed the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' astride the traditional British sea route to [[Indian Ocean]] ports, while the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' roughly tripled the numbers of [[battleship]]s, [[cruiser]]s and [[submarine]]s available to challenge British sea power. The [[Royal Navy]] had held the eastern Mediterranean and [[France]] the western Mediterranean but the [[Second Armistice at Compiègne]] removed the French navy from the alliance on 25 June 1940. From bases at [[Gibraltar]] and Alexandria, the Royal Navy attempted to convoy supplies to Malta to maintain it as a base in the central Mediterranean. As Italy attacked [[Egypt]] from [[Libya]] in September 1940 and Greece from [[Albania]] in October 1940, the Royal Navy maintained most of their [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]] at Alexandria while [[Force H]] at Gibraltar was used for raids. British successes in early November 1940 including halting the Italian offensive in Greece and disabling Italian battleships ''[[Italian battleship Littorio|Littorio]]'', ''[[Italian battleship Conte di Cavour|Conte di Cavour]]'' and ''[[Italian battleship Caio Duilio|Caio Duilio]]'' at the [[Battle of Taranto]] provided incentive and opportunity to supply Malta and Greece.&lt;ref name="p&amp;n"&gt;Potter &amp; Nimitz pp. 521–527&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparations==

===Allied===
'''Convoy MC 4''' consisted of four freighters at Gibraltar; ''Clan Cumming'', ''Clan MacDonald'' and [[List of Empire ships (Si–Sy)#Empire Song|''Empire Song'']] carried [[materiel]] destined for [[Piraeus]]; ''Essex'' carried {{convert|3000|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} of seed potatoes, {{convert|4000|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} of [[ammunition]] and twelve crated [[Hawker Hurricane]]s for Malta.&lt;ref name="r&amp;h"&gt;Rohwer &amp; Hummelchen pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Convoy MW 5''' consisted of the Freighters ''Breconshire'' and ''Clan Macaulay'' at Alexandria with cargo bound for Malta.&lt;ref name="hague"&gt;Hague p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Convoy ME 6''' was made up of nine freighters waited at Malta for passage to Alexandria.&lt;ref name="hague"/&gt;

===Axis===
Five hundred anti-shipping aircraft of [[10th Air Corps (Germany)|''Fliegerkorps'' X]] were being transferred from [[Norway]] to [[Sicily]] to protect Axis convoys to North Africa and prevent passage of British convoys to Malta.&lt;ref name="p&amp;n"/&gt;

==Battle==

===6 January 1941===

[[File:SM79 193.jpg|left|thumb|Royal Navy personnel accustomed to these ''Regia Aeronautica'' SM.79s were surprised by the intensity of ''X Fliegerkorps'' operations encountered during Operation Excess.&lt;ref name="emws"&gt;Bartimeus pp. 56–61&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Convoy MC 4 left Gibraltar, feinting toward the [[Atlantic]], before turning toward Malta after dark, to mislead Axis agents near Gibraltar.&lt;ref name="g&amp;m"/&gt;

===7 January===
Force H sailed from Gibraltar to cover convoy MC 4. Force A, Force D and convoy MW 5 with Force C sailed from Alexandria and Force B sailed from the Aegean toward Malta.&lt;ref name="hague"/&gt; Force A was located by Italian air reconnaissance that afternoon.&lt;ref name="r&amp;h"/&gt;

===8 January===
Force B landed its passengers in Malta and proceeded west to meet convoy MC 4.&lt;ref name="r&amp;h"/&gt;  [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers raided [[Naples]] damaging ''[[Italian battleship Giulio Cesare|Giulio Cesare]]'' with three near misses and causing the only operational Italian battleship ''[[Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]'' to retreat from the approaching convoys.&lt;ref name="g&amp;m"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p&amp;n"/&gt;

===9 January===
Force A was joined by Force D and {{HMAS|Sydney|D48|6}} {{convert|210|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} south-east of Malta, Force B joined convoy MC 4; Convoy MC 4 and Force H were discovered by Italian aircraft and attacked by ten [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79|SM.79s]] from Sardinia. Two SM.79s were shot down by [[Fairey Fulmar]]s from ''Ark Royal'' and a later attack by 15 [[Fiat CR.42]]s carrying {{convert|100|kg|lb|order=flip|abbr=on}} bombs also failed. Force H left convoy MC 4 that afternoon after ''Ark Royal'' launched six Swordfish for the defence of Malta; Force A joined convoy MC 4 at dusk.&lt;ref name="g&amp;m"/&gt;

===10 January===

[[File:Junkers Ju 87Bs in flight c1941.jpg|right|thumb|Few ships survived dive bombing attacks of the intensity ''Illustrious'' endured from these Ju 87 ''Stukas''.]]
Italian ships from [[La Spezia]] failed to find Force H.&lt;ref name="p&amp;n"/&gt;  The Italian submarine ''Settimo'' and [[torpedo boat]]s [[Italian torpedo boat Circe|''Circe'']] and ''Vega'' launched torpedoes against convoy MC 4 but missed.&lt;ref name="r&amp;h"/&gt;  ''Bonaventure'' and ''Hereward'' sank ''Vega'' {{convert|6|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} south of [[Pantellaria]] at 0830 and ''Circe'' escaped undamaged. ''Bonaventure'' was slightly damaged and two men killed; 75 per cent of her ammunition was expended in the engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Woodman p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Two of ''Vega''{{'s}} crew survived.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;Brown pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; Right after the engagement, which pushed the British convoy too far south of their route, ''Gallant'' struck a [[naval mine]] at 0835.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara 2013 p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;  The bow was destroyed and 65 men were killed.&lt;ref name="emws"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-25G-Gallant.htm HMS Gallant (H 59)]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Mohawk'' took ''Gallant'' in tow toward Malta while the Force B cruisers provided protection from air attacks.&lt;ref name="emws"/&gt;  Convoys MC 4 and MW 5 arrived at Malta and convoy ME 6 departed for Alexandria.&lt;ref name="hague"/&gt;

Fulmars from ''Illustrious'' shot down an Italian aircraft shadowing Force A at 0930. ''Valiant'' avoided torpedoes launched by two SM.79s approaching under the [[radar]] horizon at 1230.&lt;ref name="emws"/&gt;  As the combat air patrol Fulmars dropped altitude to engage the SM.79s, Force A was attacked at 1235 by 18 [[Heinkel He 111|He 111s]] of [[Kampfgeschwader 26|''KG'' 26]] and 43 [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87s]] of [[Sturzkampfgeschwader 1|''StG'' 1]] and [[Sturzkampfgeschwader 2|''StG'' 2]] escorted by 10 [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110s]] of [[Zerstörergeschwader 26|''ZG'' 26]].&lt;ref name="r&amp;h"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood &amp; Gunston p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Illustrious'' completed launching Fulmar and Swordfish patrol aircraft as the attack developed. ''Illustrious'' was the main target and was enveloped in waterspouts and mist of exploding bombs. Some bombers diving from an altitude of 12,000 feet delayed bomb release until they pulled-out lower than the height of ''Illustrious''{{'}} funnel. The five air patrol Fulmars had not returned from chasing the SM.79s which attacked ''Valiant'' and the four recently launched Fulmars were unable to gain altitude rapidly enough to break up the attack. The Fulmars claimed eight enemy aircraft during the bombing of Force A as they shuttled to Malta airfields to refuel and re-arm.&lt;ref name="emws"/&gt;  ''Warspite'' was lightly damaged by a bomb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-01BB-Warspite.htm HMS Warspite]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Illustrious'' was hit by five bombs, including one which failed to explode and a near miss disabled her rudder mechanism. A bomb striking a lowered elevator caused extensive hangar damage, with many casualties among aircraft maintenance personnel, nine Swordfish and five Fulmars destroyed. At 1530 ''Illustrious'' headed for Malta steering with engines. The bombing attacks continued. Seven SM.79s were discouraged by heavy anti-aircraft fire but an attack by six Italian Ju 87s at 1600 scored another bomb hit and two near misses. Fourteen German Ju 87s missed ''Valiant'' and ''Janus'' and a later attack by 14 He 111s was similarly ineffective. ''Illustrious'' reached Malta at 2130 and would suffer 126 dead and 91 wounded by the time she departed from Malta.&lt;ref name="g&amp;m"/&gt;

===11 January===
''Gallant'' was beached in Malta's Grand Harbor at dawn and never repaired.&lt;ref name="emws"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;  As ''Mohawk'' and the Force B cruisers steamed from Malta to rejoin Force A, they were surprised by 12 Ju 87R dive bombers of ''II/''St.G''.2'' attacking out of the sun at 1520.&lt;ref&gt;Pegg, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gloucester'' was hit by a bomb which failed to explode and ''Southampton'' was hit by two bombs, which killed eighty men and started fires, requiring the ship to be scuttled {{convert|180|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} east of Malta.&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; Force H returned to Gibraltar.&lt;ref name="r&amp;h"/&gt;

===12 January===
Force A was reinforced west of [[Crete]] by Force B, the cruisers of Force D, {{HMS|Barham|04|6}} and {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}} from Alexandria.&lt;ref name="r&amp;h"/&gt;

===13 January===
Convoy ME 6 arrived at Alexandria.&lt;ref name="hague"/&gt;

==The Illustrious blitz==
What Maltese called the Illustrious ''Blitz'' began when bomb stocks depleted during the attacks of 10 and 11 January were replenished and the Axis made a maximum effort to destroy ''Illustrious'' before she could be repaired. ''Illustrious'' and ''Essex'' were hit during an air raid on 16 January. Ten [[Macchi C.202]]s, ten CR.42s and twenty Bf 110s escorted 44 Ju 87s. Bombs exploding in Grand Harbour killed numerous fish, that were collected after the raid and eaten.&lt;ref name="g&amp;m"/&gt; ''Illustrious'' was not seriously damaged but a bomb exploded in ''Essex''{{'s}} engine room killing 15 men and wounding 23 more.&lt;ref name="emws"/&gt; There was another heavy air raid on 17 January and ''Illustrious'' was again hit in an air raid on 18 January.&lt;ref name="g&amp;m"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emws"/&gt;  ''Illustrious'' was not damaged by the last big attack on 19 January.&lt;ref name="g&amp;m"/&gt;  ''Illustrious'' departed Malta on 23 January but her Fulmars remained for the defence of the island.&lt;ref name="p&amp;n"/&gt;  ''Illustrious'' was able to complete additional repairs after reaching Alexandria on 25 January but restoration of full combat effectiveness required a trip to United States shipyards.&lt;ref name="g&amp;m"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pack p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Losses==
Fairey Fulmar fighters and AA gunners of the Royal Navy shot down at least seven aircraft on 10 January 1941, in defence of ''Illustrious'', while one Fulmar was lost.{{efn|''The Italian Navy in WW2'', Sadkovich, p. 114, states that 5 German and 2 Italian aircraft were shot down, while 2 FAA aircraft were lost. ''The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean Convoys'', p. 10 has, Fulmars shot down 5 aircraft while AA shot down three and one Fulmar was lost.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  No merchantmen were lost during ''Excess'' but the Royal Navy lost one cruiser sunk and a destroyer damaged beyond repair.&lt;ref&gt;''The Royal Navy and the Mediterranean Convoys''&lt;/ref&gt;
