The '''Battle of Graveney Marsh''', on the night of 27 September 1940 in [[Kent]], England, was the last ground engagement involving a foreign force to take place on the mainland of [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name=KO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/kentonline/news/2009/september/30/battle_of_graveney.aspx |title=Forgotten frontline exhibition tells how Luftwaffe fought with soldiers on Kent marshes | first= Ron |last=Green |author2=Mark Harrison |work=KentOnline |date=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teleg&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/world-war-2/7956015/Kent-battle-between-German-bomber-crew-and-British-soldiers-marked-after-70-years.html|title=Kent battle between German bomber crew and British soldiers marked after 70 years|date=20 August 2010|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=20 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100823025714/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/world-war-2/7956015/Kent-battle-between-German-bomber-crew-and-British-soldiers-marked-after-70-years.html| archivedate= 23 August 2010 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fighting took place between the crew of a shot-down [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Junkers Ju 88]]A-1 bomber from [[KG 77]] and a detachment of soldiers from the 1st Battalion, [[London Irish Rifles]] (1&amp;nbsp;LIR) in [[Seasalter]].  The Ju&amp;nbsp;88, ''W.Nr&amp;nbsp;088&amp;nbsp;8099'', 3Z+EL, and nicknamed ''Eule'' ("Owl") by its crew, had only entered service two weeks earlier.  It was crewed by ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' (Uffz) Fritz Ruhlandt (pilot), ''[[Feldwebel]]'' Gotthard Richter ([[bomb aimer]]); Uffz Erwin Richter (radio operator/gunner); and ''Flieger'' (Private) Jakob Reiner (gunner).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=The Last Battle in Britain: The Battle of Graveney Marsh, by Don Hollway|url=http://www.donhollway.com/graveneymarsh/index.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-06-18|website=www.donhollway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

RAF fighter pilots, from [[No. 66 Squadron RAF|66 Squadron]] ([[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]]) and [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|92 Squadron]] ([[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]), had attacked the Ju&amp;nbsp;88 over [[Faversham]]. Previously, fighter pilots had been ordered to, when possible,  force German bomber crews to land or crash land, so that they and their aircraft could be captured intact,&lt;ref name=KO/&gt; for intelligence purposes. On this occasion, one of the bomber's engines had already been damaged by anti-aircraft fire during a raid on London and, after the fighter pilots were able to destroy its remaining engine, Ruhlandt made a crash landing on Graveney Marsh. The entire crew survived the crash.

When members of 1&amp;nbsp;LIR, billeted nearby at the Sportsman Inn in [[Seasalter]], arrived at the crash site, the four German aviators were attempting to destroy classified equipment on board the aircraft,&lt;ref name="Hollway"&gt;Hollway, Don.

(The latter was part of a standard [[survival kit]], issued at the time to the crews of ''Luftwaffe'' bomber, patrol and transport aircraft.) The British opened fire and one of the Germans was hit in the foot.&lt;ref name="Hollway" /&gt;  The crew then surrendered and were taken prisoner.  The RAF Historical Branch later stated that “some sort of fight took place, but it is far from clear that the [German] crew fired at anything but their own aircraft.”&lt;ref name="Hollway" /&gt;

After one of the Germans indicated that the aircraft might explode at any moment, [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] John Cantopher located an object –which he described as a "black box" – and threw it away from the aircraft into a drainage ditch.&lt;ref name="Hollway" /&gt; Historian Don Hollway suggests that the object may have been the sealed housing of a [[Bombenzielanlage (BZA)|BZA]] computer bombsight computer, and its finding was unpublicised by the Ministry of Defence, to prevent German commanders from knowing that it had been captured.&lt;ref name="Hollway" /&gt;  

The prisoners were taken to the Sportsman Inn and given pints of beer.&lt;ref name="Hollway" /&gt;  The bomber was captured for examination by British experts. The aircraft was taken to [[Farnborough Airfield]] where it was said to have "provided highly valuable information".&lt;ref name=KO/&gt; Cantopher was subsequently awarded the [[George Medal]] for his action.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=35050|supp=y|page=462|date=21 January 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7675076|title=Recommendations for Honours and Awards (Army)|work=DocumentsOnline|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|format=pdf |url-access=subscription |accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, the London Irish Rifles Regimental Association marked its 70th anniversary by unveiling a commemorative plaque at the Sportsman pub.&lt;ref name=teleg/&gt;
