In March 1945 the Allies were preparing a new offensive, [[Operation Buckland]], in [[Northern Italy]].&lt;ref name=Wawer9&gt;Zbigniew Wawer, ''Zdobycie Bolonii'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The capture of Bologna, an important regional communication hub, was set as a part of that offensive.

The morale of the Polish forces was weakened by the outcome of the [[Yalta Conference]] which ended on 11 February, where the British and Americans, without consultation with the Poles, had decided to give a major part of the 1921–1939 [[territorial changes of Poland after World War II|Polish territories to the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=Wawer8&gt;Zbigniew Wawer, ''Zdobycie Bolonii'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven J.

Anders eventually decided to keep the Polish units engaged.&lt;ref name=Wawer8/&gt;&lt;ref name=ajj/&gt;

==Battle==
The offensive on Bologna started on 9 April at 4:00 am local time, with a major air and artillery bombardment of 400 guns firing on German positions, followed by an advance of ground forces the same evening.&lt;ref name=Wawer9/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eyewitness account, G.Z.

The town was to be taken initially by the American troops of the Fifth Army advancing from the south.&lt;ref name=Wawer9/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wawer13&gt;Zbigniew Wawer, ''Zdobycie Bolonii'', p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 April the 3rd Carpathian Rifle Brigade of the [[Polish 3rd Carpathian Infantry Division]] entered the city, where only isolated German units were still fighting.&lt;ref name=Wawer9/&gt; (Another source attributes the entrance to the Polish 5th Kresowa Division).&lt;ref name="Koskodan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth K.

==Aftermath==
The Battle of Bologna was the last battle of the Polish II Corps, which was taken out of the front line on 22 April.&lt;ref name=Wawer9/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wawer13/&gt; American and British troops completed their encirclement of the Germans forces north of the [[Reno River]], the [[8th Infantry Division (India)|8th Indian Division]] crossed the [[Po River]] and the German forces in Italy capitulated on 29 April.&lt;ref name=Wawer9/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wawer13/&gt; The Polish II Corps, commanded by General Zygmunt Bohusz-Szyszko, suffered 234 dead and 1,228 wounded out of 55,780 front line personnel.&lt;ref name=Wawer8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wawer13/&gt;

German divisions were left in disarray, and as the end of the war neared, many splintered into small groups in order to retreat across the Po and try to reach the passes into Germany. The 65th Infantry Division lost its commander, Generalmajor [[Hellmuth Pfeifer]] in the last days of the war as he tried to make his way north with the remnants of divisional headquarters. &lt;ref&gt;Velten, Wilhelm ''Vom Kugelbaum zur Hangranate: Die Gesichte der 65. Infanterie Division''&lt;/ref&gt;
