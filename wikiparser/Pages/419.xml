The '''Upper Silesian Offensive''' was a strategically significant [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] offensive on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] of [[World War II]] in 1945. It was aimed at capturing the considerable industrial and natural resources located in [[Upper Silesia]] and involved forces of the [[1st Ukrainian Front]] under Marshal [[Ivan Konev]]. Due to the importance of the region to the Germans, considerable forces were provided to [[Army Group Centre]] for its defence and the Germans were only slowly pushed back to the [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] border. Fighting for the region lasted from mid January right until the last day of the [[Second World War|war in Europe]] on May 8, 1945.

== Prelude ==
{{refimprove|section|date=March 2017}}

The front lines in Silesia had been established at the end of the [[Vistula-Oder Offensive]] in January, during which Konev's troops had forced the German [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|Seventeenth Army]] of General [[Friedrich Schulz]] out of the industrial heartland of Upper Silesia around [[Katowice|Kattowitz]]. The [[Lower Silesian Offensive Operation]], taking place in February, had seen the northern wing of Konev's forces make further gains, closing up to the [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]] River. This had, however, left a long exposed flank to the south and east in the [[Sudetes|Sudeten Mountains]], still held by Schulz's troops, which formed a potential threat to the proposed Soviet advance on Berlin.

=== Operation Gemse: the German counter-attacks at Lauban and Striegau ===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J31305, Auszeichnung des Hitlerjungen Willi Hübner.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joseph Goebbels]] awards 16-year-old [[Hitler Youth]] member Willi Hübner the [[Iron Cross]] for the defense of [[Lubań|Lauban]].]]
The commander of [[Army Group Centre]], Field-Marshal [[Ferdinand Schörner]], began to build up Schulz's forces during February for a counter-attack against the [[3rd Guards Tank Army (Soviet Union)|3rd Guards Tank Army]]'s spearheads, which had reached and taken [[Lubań|Lauban]] during the Lower Silesian Offensive. The [[LVI Panzer Corps (Germany)|LVI Panzer Corps]] and [[XXXIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXIX Panzer Corps]] were grouped under the command of General [[Walther Nehring|Nehring]]; a two-pronged attack began on 1 March, with the [[17th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|17th Panzer]] and Führer Grenadier Divisions attacking in the north, and [[8th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|8th Panzer Division]] to the south.&lt;ref name=duffyp139&gt;Duffy, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd Guards Tank Army was initially taken by surprise, though by 3 March German forces found themselves threatened by Soviet counterattacks from [[Nowogrodziec|Naumberg]]. As a result, Nehring decided on a more limited plan of encirclement. Rybalko's troops evacuated Lauban to avoid being cut off, and the town was retaken by the [[6th Volksgrenadier Division (Germany)|6th Volksgrenadier Division]]. By 4 March, the encirclement was closed, though large numbers of Soviet troops were able to escape; within 4 days the trapped force had been destroyed (the fighting in Silesia has been characterised as "merciless", with German forces not taking prisoners).&lt;ref name=Beevor&gt;Beevor, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the limited nature of the victory, the recapture of [[Lubań|Lauban]] was presented as a great success by German [[propaganda]], with [[Joseph Goebbels]] visiting the town on 9 March to give a speech on the battle. Schörner made preparations for a further attack to the south-east at [[Strzegom|Striegau]], which was commenced on 9 March. Though there were not enough forces available for a double envelopment, the Germans were able to penetrate the Soviet lines and cut off elements of the [[5th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|5th Guards Army]] on the night of 11–12 March; there was an outbreak of panic amongst the trapped troops, who were massacred by Schörner's men as they tried to escape.&lt;ref name=duffyp141&gt;Duffy, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Schörner began to organise a more ambitious offensive to the north to relieve the besieged city of [[Wrocław|Breslau]], moving Nehring's divisions northwards from [[Lubań|Lauban]] by rail, but Konev acted decisively to regain the initiative in Silesia. Shifting the [[4th Tank Army (Soviet Union)|4th Tank Army]] from the northern flank of his Front, he redeployed it near [[Grodków|Grottkau]] in order to spearhead a major attack into [[Upper Silesia]], neutralising the threat to the left flank of his forces and taking the area around [[Racibórz|Ratibor]].

*Air support from [[Luftflotte 4]].

==The offensive==
[[File:Pomerania and Silesia.jpg|thumb|Pomeranian and Silesian offensives]]
Konev launched his main attack on 15 March. The 4th Tank Army broke through the German lines west of [[Opole|Oppeln]] and drove directly southward, heading for [[Prudnik|Neustadt]]. A subsidiary attack by the [[4th Guards Tank Corps (Soviet Union)|4th Guards Tank Corps]] fanned out to take [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse]]. South-east of Oppeln, the 59th and 60th Armies also broke through, the former swinging westwards to link up with the 4th Tank Army. The First Panzer Army's [[XI Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XI Corps]], holding the lines near Oppeln, was now threatened with encirclement.

In the south, the 38th Army attacked German troops of the [[LIX Corps (Germany)|LIX Corps]] defending with their backs to the highlands of [[Moravia]]. By means of a limited tactical withdrawal on 10 March, Heinrici was able to minimise the damage inflicted by the preparatory bombardment, and the front in this sector remained firm.&lt;ref name=duffyp147&gt;Duffy, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The encirclement at Oppeln===
The [[LVI Panzer Corps]] positioned near Oppeln also started to pull back, but the [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)|20th Grenadier (Estonian)]] Division of the [[SS]] and [[168th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|168th Infantry Division]] found themselves trapped by the advance of the 4th Tank Army and 59th Army which linked up near [[Prudnik|Neustadt]]. By the 22nd, Soviet forces of the 59th and 21st Armies succeeded in reducing the Oppeln 'cauldron' ({{lang-de|Kessel}}), claiming to have killed 15,000 and captured a further 15,000 of the German troops trapped there.&lt;ref name=beevorp129&gt;Beevor, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Konev launched further attacks on 24 March, and by 31 March, when [[Racibórz|Ratibor]] and [[Kietrz|Katscher]] were taken, was able to declare the offensive phase of operations over.&lt;ref name=duffyp146&gt;Duffy, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Upper Silesian Offensive succeeded in stabilising Konev's left flank in preparation for the advance on Berlin, and removed the threat of any German counter-attacks from [[Army Group Centre]]. The lines in Silesia remained largely unchanged until the end of the war, when Schoerner's force surrendered.
