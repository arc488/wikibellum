The '''Osovets Offensive''' ({{lang-ru|Осовецкая наступательная операция}}) was part of the third and final phase of [[Operation Bagration]], the Belorussian Strategic Offensive of the [[Red Army]] in summer 1944. The offensive began August 6 and was officially declared over as of August 14, although some of its objectives were not achieved until as late as January 1945.

''Osovets'' is the Russianised version of the Polish name [[Osowiec-Twierdza|Osowiec]] / Ossowiec / Ossowitz.

==Operational goals==
The offensive commenced after the [[2nd Belorussian Front]] had successfully taken [[Grodno]] and [[Białystok]] in the [[Belostock Offensive]] (''Belostock'' is the Russianised version of the Polish name Białystok). The Front was issued with new objectives at the end of July, being ordered to move on [[Łomża]] ({{lang-de|Lomscha}}) and [[Ostrołęka]] ({{lang-de|Scharfenwiese}}) and to enlarge bridgeheads over the [[Narew]] river in preparation for a further advance into [[East Prussia]].

The defenders were somewhat aided by fortifications from previous eras, including a major [[Imperial Russia]]n-era [[Osowiec Fortress|fortress complex at Osowiec]] on the [[Biebrza]] River that was a scene of a siege in 1915 (February to August) during the [[First World War]], and which was partly demolished by ''Wehrmacht'' troops in 1939 before its hand-over to the Red Army. There were also substantial Soviet border fortifications remaining from the [[Molotov Line]] located 20&amp;nbsp;km west of the old fortress.

==Deployments==

===''Wehrmacht''===
* Elements of [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourth Army]] (General [[Friedrich Hossbach]])

* Elements of [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|Second Army]] (Colonel-General [[Walter Weiss]])
**[[LV Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|LV Corps]] (General [[Friedrich Herrlein]])

The above units were under the overall command of [[Army Group Centre]] (Field-Marshal [[Walter Model]]).

==The offensive==
{{Expand section|date=April 2008}}
The offensive began on August 6 with further penetrations by the 2nd Belorussian Front west of Bialystok.

The approaches to Osowiec were heavily defended; the [[1st Guards Assault Engineer Brigade]] was required to establish river crossings under fire.&lt;ref name="verizov"&gt;[http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=8506 Biography of Aslan Verizov]&lt;/ref&gt; Units of the Front stormed and took the fortress, after a heavy air bombardment by Major-General [[Georgy Baydukov]]'s [[4th Assault Aviation Corps]], on August 14.&lt;ref name="RIA"&gt;See [http://eng.9may.ru/21.08.1944/eng_inform/m9001853 RIA Novosti Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720160054/http://eng.9may.ru/21.08.1944/eng_inform/m9001853 |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Order no. 166 for that day noted the capture of the fortress and congratulated the units and commanders involved.

August 14 is noted as the end of the offensive in official Soviet historiography, but in fact attempts continued to seize bridgeheads over the [[Narew]] throughout the remainder of August. The 49th Army, however, found that the German defences on the approaches to Lomza were difficult to overcome, sustaining many casualties (even losing a divisional commander, Major-General Yakimovich of the [[343rd Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|343rd Rifle Division]], in their attempt to force the defensive lines).&lt;ref name="maslovp155"&gt;Maslov, p.155&lt;/ref&gt;

Lomza itself was not taken until mid-September; there were intense battles along the Narew as [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|Second Army]] was progressively reinforced and attempted to crush the bridgeheads.

==Aftermath==
Although there were many local actions (including attacks by Polish partisans, who had a strong presence in the area) the German defence line on the Narew held through the remainder of 1944, until the 2nd Belorussian Front's advance in the [[East Prussian Operation]] of January 1945.
