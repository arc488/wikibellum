The '''Battle of Noemfoor''' was a battle of [[World War II]] that took place on the island of [[Noemfoor]], in [[Dutch New Guinea]], between 2 July and 31 August 1944. United States and Australian forces attacked to capture [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] bases on the island.

==Background==
Noemfoor is an [[ellipse|elliptical]], almost circular shape. It is approximately {{convert|11|mi|km|abbr=on}} in diameter and encircled by [[coral reef]]s.&lt;ref name=Gill442&gt;{{cite book | last = Gill | first = G.

The island was occupied by Japanese forces in December 1943.&lt;ref name=Pacific1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pacificwrecks.com/provinces/irian_noemfor.html | title = Noemfoor (Noemfoer) Island | accessdate = 26 December 2007 | publisher = Pacific Wreck Database | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071229215651/http://www.pacificwrecks.com/provinces/irian_noemfor.html| archivedate= 29 December 2007 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous civilian population numbered about 5,000 people, most of whom lived a [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] lifestyle in coastal villages.&lt;ref name=Smith397/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith400&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Robert Ross | title = United States Army in World War II: The War in the Pacific; The Approach to the Philippines | year = 1953 | month = | url = | series = Chapter XVII | date = | publisher = Center of Military History, United States Army | location = Washington, D.C. | pages = 400 | chapter = Operations on Noemfoor Island | chapterurl =  | quote = | ref = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forced&gt;{{Cite document | date = 20 July 1944 | title = Japanese Forced into Hills in New Guinea; Try Flanking Move to Escape Aitape Trap | work=The New York Times | id= 1504769 | url = http://hn.bigchalk.com/hnweb/hn/do/document?set=searchera&amp;start=1&amp;rendition=x-article-image&amp;inmylist=false&amp;urn=urn%3Aproquest%3AUS%3BPQDOC%3BHNP%3BPQD%3BHNP%3BPROD%3Bx-article-image%3B86873468&amp;mylisturn=urn%3Aproquest%3AUS%3BPQDOC%3BHNP%3BPQD%3BHNP%3BPROD%3Bx-citation%3B86873468 | accessdate = 26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island was also hosting about 1,100 laborers taken to Noemfoor by the Japanese: a 600-strong [[Taiwanese people|Formosan]] (Taiwanese) auxiliary labor unit and 500 Indonesian civilian [[forced labor]]ers. According to the official U.S. Army history, over 3,000 Indonesian men, women, and children were shipped to Noemfoor by the Japanese military.&lt;ref name=Forced/&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith421-2&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Robert Ross | title = United States Army in World War II: The War in the Pacific; The Approach to the Philippines

These Javanese civilians were forced to construct roads and airfields, mostly by hand. Little food, clothing, shelter or medical attention were provided. Many attempted to steal Japanese supplies, and were executed. Others died from starvation and preventable disease. Survivors also alleged that sick Javanese were buried alive.&lt;ref name=Smith421-2/&gt; The Formosan labor troops had originally numbered about 900 men.&lt;ref name=Forced/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith421-2"/&gt; They had also worked on airfield and road construction, on ½ the ration of rice issued to regular Japanese troops.&lt;ref name="Smith421-2"/&gt; When they became ill from exhaustion, hunger, or tropical diseases, they were put in a convalescent camp. In the words of the U.S. official history: "There, their rations were again cut in half, and the shelter and blankets provided covered but a fraction of the inmates. Medical care was given only to the worse cases, and then was inadequate."&lt;ref name="Smith421-2"/&gt;

The Japanese built three airfields on the island, turning it into a significant air base.&lt;ref name= Pacific1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Seized/&gt;
*[[Kornasoren Airport|Kornasoren Airfield/Yebrurro Airfield]], located toward the northern end of the island
*Kamiri Airfield, on the northwestern edge of the island
*Namber Airfield, on the west coast of the island.

Bombing of the island by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) and [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) began as early as April 1944.&lt;ref name=Pacific2&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pacificwrecks.com/airfields/indonesia/kornasoren/missions-noemfoor.html | title = American Missions Against Noemfoor Island [General References] | accessdate = 26 December 2007 | publisher = Pacific Wreck Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noemfoor was also used as a staging area for Japanese troops moving to [[battle of Biak|reinforce Biak]],&lt;ref name=Smith397/&gt; which was invaded by the Allies in May 1944. Japanese barges could travel from [[Manokwari]] to Noemfoor—about {{convert|60|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}}—during one night. Japanese forces on Biak had been defeated by 20 June.

In describing his preparations for the [[Western New Guinea campaign]], General [[Douglas MacArthur]] wrote in his memoirs that: "[t]he [[Operations Reckless and Persecution|Hollandia Invasion]] initiated a marked change in the tempo of my advance westward. Subsequent assaults against [[Battle of Wakde|Wakde]], [[Battle of Biak|Biak]], Noemfoor, and [[Sansapor Airfield|Sansapor]] were mounted in quick succession, and, in contrast to previous campaigns, I planned no attempt to complete all phases of one operation before moving on to the next objective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = 18 September 1964 | title = Bayonets Westward | newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] | url = http://hn.bigchalk.com/hnweb/hn/do/document?set=search&amp;start=1&amp;rendition=x-article-image&amp;inmylist=false&amp;urn=urn%3Aproquest%3AUS%3BPQDOC%3BHNP%3BPQD%3BHNP%3BPROD%3Bx-article-image%3B578120602&amp;mylisturn=urn%3Aproquest%3AUS%3BPQDOC%3BHNP%3BPQD%3BHNP%3BPROD%3Bx-citation%3B578120602 | accessdate = 26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Noemfoor was selected for invasion for four reasons:&lt;ref name=Odgers236-7&gt;{{cite book | last = Odgers | first = George | series = [[Australia in the War of 1939–1945]] | title = Air War Against Japan, 1943–1945 | origyear = 1957 | url = | accessdate = 31 January 2008 | edition = | date = 1968 | publisher = Australian War Memorial | location = Canberra | isbn = | pages = 236–7 | chapter = Chapter 15—To Noemfoor and Morotai | chapterurl =https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070730--1-.pdf| quote = | ref = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Allied commanders believed that Japanese troops equivalent to less than one [[battalion]] would be based there;
*the Allies were already experiencing a shortage of amphibious vessels and Noemfoor could be seized without large-scale operations;
*it also had the greatest number of useful airfields in the smallest area and;
*Japanese air defences in western New Guinea were almost negligible. (At the end of June, RAAF HQ reported that although the Namber and Kamiri airfields were serviceable, they were barely being used and "a possibly generous" estimate suggested that only 19 Japanese bombers and 37 fighters remained in New Guinea.)

==Forces==
MacArthur selected the [[158th Infantry Regiment (United States)|158th Regimental Combat Team]], primarily units from the [[Arizona Army National Guard|Arizona National Guard]], [[United States Army]]—commanded by [[Major General]] [[Edwin D. Patrick]]—to assault the island in '''Operation Cyclone''', from 2 July.&lt;ref name=Pacific1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pacific2/&gt;&lt;ref name=WW2DB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | date = 18 February 1968 | title = Gen.

In mid-June, [[Australian First Tactical Air Force|No. 10 Operational Group RAAF]], under [[Air Commodore]] [[Frederick Scherger]], was designated the controlling Allied air force unit for Operation Cyclone.&lt;ref name=Odgers237&gt;{{cite book | last = Odgers | first = George | series = Australia in the War of 1939–1945 | title = Air War Against Japan, 1943–1945 | origyear = 1957 | date = 1968 | publisher = Australian War Memorial | location = Canberra | isbn = | pages = 237 | chapter = Chapter 15—To Noemfoor and Morotai | chapterurl = | quote = | ref = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The USAAF units attached to 10 OG for the invasion comprised: the [[58th Fighter Wing|58th]] and 348th Fighter Groups and the 307th, 309th and 417th Bombardment Groups.

The 8,000-strong invasion force – composed primarily of the 158th RCT and [[No. 62 Wing RAAF]] (Works)&lt;ref&gt;Later known as No. 62 (Airfield Construction) Wing.&lt;/ref&gt; – was known as Cyclone Task Force. A 40-strong contingent of Dutch civil administration personnel was also included.

Facing them were approximately 2,000 Japanese troops, mostly from the 219th Infantry Regiment as well as some from the 222nd Infantry Regiment, who had been in transit to Biak. The garrison was commanded by [[Colonel]] Suesada Shimizu,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;!-- U.S. Army history says his given name could not be ascertained; the source for this should be spelled out.--&gt; also CO of the 219th Regiment.

At the beginning of July 1944, various kinds of Japanese aircraft were at the Noemfoor airfields.&lt;ref name=Pacific3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificwrecks.com/airfields/indonesia/wakde/wakde-history.html |title=Japanese Operations at Wakde Island Aerodrome |accessdate=3 February 2008 |publisher=Pacific Wreck Database |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021230847/http://www.pacificwrecks.com/airfields/indonesia/wakde/wakde-history.html |archivedate=21 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that elements of ''61° Hiko [[Sentai]]'' ("No. 61 Air Group"/"61st Flying Regiment") in particular, flying [[Mitsubishi Ki-21]] ("Sally") bombers, were based at Kamiri.&lt;ref name=Pacific1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pacific3/&gt; (However, Japanese aircraft played no significant role in the ensuing battle; see below.)

Reports indicated that approximately 45 Japanese soldiers were killed, and about 30 Japanese planes captured, although all of these were damaged as a result of the earlier bombardment and bombing.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;

The following day, as a precaution against Japanese resistance elsewhere, the 2,000 paratroopers of the [[503rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 503rd Parachute Regiment]] were dropped onto the island.&lt;ref name=Pacific1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith412&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Robert Ross | title = United States Army in World War II: The War in the Pacific; The Approach to the Philippines | year = 1953 | month = | edition = | series = Chapter XVII | date = | publisher = Center of Military History, United States Army | location = Washington, D.C. | pages = 412 | chapter = Operations on Noemfoor Island | chapterurl = | quote = | ref = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==
By 31 August, Cyclone Task Force had lost 66 killed or missing and 343 wounded. It had killed approximately 1,714 Japanese and taken 186 prisoners.&lt;ref name=Gill443/&gt;

According to the U.S. Army official history, only 403 of the original 3,000 Javanese civilian laborers were alive by 31 August.&lt;ref name="Smith421-2"/&gt; About 10–15 were reported to have been killed accidentally by Allied forces. The rest had died from mistreatment before the invasion.&lt;ref name="Smith421-2"/&gt;

About 300 Formosan labor troops had died before the invasion.&lt;ref name="Smith421-2"/&gt; Others fought the Allies, allegedly as a result of Japanese coercion. Over 550 surrendered; more than half of these were suffering from starvation and tropical diseases.&lt;ref name="Smith421-2"/&gt; Less than 20 were reported killed by Allied action.

According to the U.S. Army historian, Allied personnel found evidence that human bodies, of Japanese, Formosan and Allied personnel, had been partly eaten by starving Japanese and Formosans.&lt;ref name="Smith421-2"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Allied airfield repair and construction work by the RAAF and [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Engineers]] began on 2 July.&lt;ref name=Smith422&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Robert Ross | title = United States Army in World War II: The War in the Pacific; The Approach to the Philippines | year = 1953 | month = | series = Chapter XVII | date = | publisher = Center of Military History, United States Army | location = Washington, D.C. | pages = 422 | chapter = Operations on Noemfoor Island | chapterurl = | quote = | ref = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the afternoon of 6 July, before the formal cessation of hostilities on the ground, an RAAF [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40]] fighter squadron had landed at Kamiri,&lt;ref name="Smith421-2"/&gt; supporting operations on Noemfoor and becoming the first of many Allied air force units to be based there.

Namber Airfield was assessed as too rough and badly graded to be effectively used by Allied aircraft.&lt;ref name=Smith423&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Robert Ross | title = United States Army in World War II: The War in the Pacific; The Approach to the Philippines | year = 1953 | month = | series = Chapter XVII | date = | publisher = Center of Military History, United States Army | location = Washington, D.C. | pages = 423 | chapter = Operations on Noemfoor Island | chapterurl = | quote = | ref = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was abandoned in favor of expansion and improvements at Kornasoren.
