'''Operation Diadem''', also referred to as the '''[[Battle of Monte Cassino#Fourth and final battle|Fourth Battle of Monte Cassino]]''' or, in [[Canada]], the '''Battle of the Liri Valley''', was an offensive operation undertaken by the [[Allies of World War II]] ([[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] and [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]) in May 1944, as part of the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. ''Diadem'' was supported by air attacks called [[Operation Strangle (World War II)|Operation Strangle]]. The opposing force was the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]].

The object of ''Diadem'' was to break the German defenses on the Gustav Line (the western half of the [[Winter Line]]) and open up the [[Liri River|Liri Valley]], the main route to [[Rome]]. [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]], Commander-in-Chief of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]], planned ''Diadem'' to coordinate roughly with the [[invasion of Normandy]], so that German forces would be tied down in Italy, and could not be redeployed to France.

Four corps were employed in the attack. From right to left these were the [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]] and the [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British XIII Corps]], of the Eighth Army, and the [[Free French Forces|Free French Corps]] (including [[Morocco|Moroccan]] ''[[Goumier]]s'') and the [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]], of the Fifth Army. The Fifth Army also controlled the [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. VI Corps]] in the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio beachhead]], some 60 miles northwest.

''Diadem'' was launched at 23:00 pm on 11 May 1944 by elements of the [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 4th Infantry Division]] and [[8th Infantry Division (India)|8th Indian Infantry Division]], with supporting fire from the [[1st Canadian Armoured Brigade]]. They made a successful strongly opposed night crossing of the Garigliano and Rapido rivers. This broke into the heart of the German defenses in the Liri valley against strong opposition and drew in German theater reserves, reducing pressure on the Anzio beachhead. The Free French Corps pushed through the mountains to the left on 14 May, supported by U.S. II Corps along the coast. On 17 May, Polish II Corps on the right attacked Monte Cassino.

When their position collapsed, the Germans fell back from the Gustav Line to the [[Hitler Line]] some 10 miles to their rear.

On 23 May, the four corps attacked the Hitler Line. On the same day, the U.S. VI Corps [[Battle of Anzio#Breakout|attacked out of the Anzio beachhead]].

The Hitler Line was breached by the [[1st Canadian Division|1st Canadian Infantry Division]]'s [[4th Princess Louise Dragoon Guards]] at [[Pontecorvo]] on 23 May. The German Tenth Army was forced to retire northwestward. The U.S. VI Corps, moving northeast from Anzio, was at the point of cutting off the German line of retreat when [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Mark W. Clark]], commander of the Fifth Army, inexplicably ordered them to turn northwest and advance on Rome instead. There is much speculation that he did this so that his Fifth Army would capture Rome ahead of the Eighth Army advancing up the Liri Valley. The German Tenth Army thus avoided being surrounded.

The Germans fought a series of delaying actions, retired to the [[Trasimene Line]], and then to the [[Gothic Line]] (identified on German maps as the "Green" Line), north of the [[Arno River]].
