The '''Raid on Alexandria''' was carried out on 19 December 1941 by [[Italian Navy]] divers of the [[Decima Flottiglia MAS]], who attacked and disabled two [[Royal Navy]] battleships in the harbour of [[Alexandria]], Egypt, using [[Human torpedo|manned torpedo]]es.

==Background==
On 3 December, the [[submarine]] {{Ship|Italian submarine|Scirè|1938|2}} of the Italian [[Regia Marina|Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]]'') under the command of [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]] [[Junio Valerio Borghese]] left the naval base of [[La Spezia]] carrying three manned torpedoes, nicknamed ''maiali'' (pigs) by the [[Italians]].&lt;ref&gt;Borghese, page 135&lt;/ref&gt; At the island of [[Leros]] in the [[Aegean Sea]], the submarine secretly picked up six crewmen for them: [[Luigi Durand de la Penne]] and Emilio Bianchi ([[Manned torpedo#Italy|''maiale'']] nº 221), [[Vincenzo Martellotta]] and [[Mario Marino]] (''maiale'' nº 222), and [[Antonio Marceglia]] and [[Spartaco Schergat]] (''maiale'' nº 223).&lt;ref&gt;Borghese, pp. 134–136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Raid==

{{Primary sources|section|date=February 2020}}

On 19 December, ''Scirè''—at a depth of {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}}—released the manned torpedoes {{convert|1.3|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} from Alexandria commercial harbour,&lt;ref&gt;Borghese, page 143&lt;/ref&gt; and they entered the naval base when the British opened their defenses to let three of their destroyers pass. There were many difficulties for de la Penne and his crewmate Emilio Bianchi. First, the engine of the torpedo stopped and the two frogmen had to manually push it; then Bianchi had to surface due to problems with the oxygen provider, so that de la Penne had to push the ''maiale'' alone to where {{HMS|Valiant|1914|6}} lay. There he successfully placed the [[limpet mine]], just under the hull of the battleship. However, as they both had to surface, and as Bianchi was hurt, they were discovered and captured.{{Citation needed|date = December 2016}}

Questioned, both of them kept silent, and they were confined in a compartment aboard ''Valiant'', below the water line, and coincidentally just over the place where the mine had been placed. Fifteen minutes before the explosion, de la Penne asked to meet with ''Valiant''{{'}}s captain Charles Morgan and then told him of the imminent explosion but refused to give further information, so that he was returned to the compartment. When the mine exploded just beneath them, neither was severely injured by the blast, de la Penne only receiving a minor injury to the head from a ship chain.&lt;ref&gt;Borghese, pp. 148–151&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Citation is not a publication of historical research. It may not be precise. It may contain dramatization.|date=February 2020}}

Meanwhile, Marceglia and Schergat had attached their device five feet beneath the battleship {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}}'s keel as scheduled. They successfully left the harbour area at 4:30&amp;nbsp;am, and slipped through Alexandria posing as [[France|French]] sailors. They were captured two days later at [[Rosetta]] by the [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]]ian police while awaiting rescue by ''Scirè'' and handed over to the British.&lt;ref&gt;Borghese, pp. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt;

Martellotta and Marino searched in vain for an aircraft carrier purportedly moored at Alexandria, but after some time they decided to attack a large tanker, the 7,554 [[gross register tonnage|gross register ton]] Norwegian ''Sagona''. Marino fixed the mine under the tanker's stern at 02:55. Both divers managed to land unmolested, but were eventually arrested at an Egyptian police checkpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Borghese, pp. 155–156&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, all the divers were made prisoners, though they succeeded in severely damaging both ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Valiant'', disabling them for nine months and six months respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Sadkovich, page 217&lt;/ref&gt; Eight members of ''Queen Elizabeth'''s crew were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naval-history.net/xDKCas1941-12DEC2.htm#prof|title=Royal Navy casualties, killed and died, December 1941|website=www.naval-history.net|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Sagona'' lost her stern section and the destroyer {{HMS|Jervis|F00|6}}, one of four alongside her refuelling, was badly damaged. Neither of the two capital ships sank but they were out of action for several months.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, pp.120–121: "Prior to the attack'' Queen Elizabeth'' had a draught of 33ft 5in forward and 32ft 7in aft; after the explosion: draught 41ft 10in forward, 33ft 10in aft." ''Queen Elizabeth'' was moored in approximately 48ft (8 fathoms) of water.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, David. p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
This represented a dramatic change of fortunes against the Allies from the strategic point of view during the next six months. The Italian fleet had temporarily wrested [[naval supremacy]] in the east-central Mediterranean from the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;"Consequently, the Alexandria Fleet remained for many months without any battleships, and it was forced to abandon any further open activity. In fact, Admiral Cunningham wrote that his Fleet now ′should have to leave it to the Royal Air Force to try if they could dispute the control of the Central Mediterranean with the enemy's fleet.′(...) In fact, it opened a period of clear Italian naval supremacy in the east-central Mediterranean." Bragadin, page 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Overnight, the sea had became an Axis lake. And the Italian Navy held dominating power." Schofield, Williams, and Carisella, P. J. (2004).  ''Frogmen:First Battles''. Branden Books, p. 134. {{ISBN|0-8283-2088-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The results of the attack would not be immediately known, but details would slip out in the coming weeks. The balance of power at sea had shifted." Greene, Jack &amp; Massignani, Alessandro (1998). ''The Naval War in the Mediterranean, 1940–1943'', Chatam Publishing, p. 204. {{ISBN|978-1-86176-057-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sadkovich, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

''Valiant'' was towed to Admiralty Floating Dock 5 on the 21st for temporary repairs and was under repair at Alexandria until April 1942 when she sailed to [[Durban]]. By August, she was operating with Force B off Africa in exercises for the defence of East Africa and [[Battle of Madagascar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-01BB-Valiant.htm HMS Valiant] at naval-history.net&lt;/ref&gt;

''Queen Elizabeth'' was in drydock at Alexandria for temporary repairs until late June, when she sailed for the United States for refit and repairs, which ended the following June. The refit was completed in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-01BB-Queen%20Elizabeth.htm HMS Queen Elizabeth] at naval-history.net&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jervis'' was repaired and operational again by the end of January.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naval-history.net/xGM-Chrono-10DD-36J-JervisJERVIS%201a.htm HMS Jervis] at naval-history.net&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
The attack is dramatised at the beginning of the film ''[[The Silent Enemy (1958 film)|The Silent Enemy]]'' (1958). Another movie ''[[The Valiant (1962 film)|The Valiant]]'' (1962), is about the damage to HMS ''Valiant'' in Alexandria harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0052197|title=The Silent Enemy}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a 1953 Italian movie (''[[Hell Raiders of the Deep|I sette dell'Orsa Maggiore]]'') about the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045142/ |title=''Hell Raiders of the Deep''|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2016-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
