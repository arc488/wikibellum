The '''Baltic Offensive''', also known as the '''Baltic Strategic Offensive''',&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, p. 203; Muriev, pp. 22–28; Stilwell, p. 343; Проэктор.&lt;/ref&gt; denotes the campaign between the northern [[Front (Soviet Army)|Fronts]] of the [[Red Army]] and the German [[Army Group North]] in the [[Baltic States]] during the autumn of 1944. The result of the series of battles was the isolation and encirclement of the Army Group North in the [[Courland Pocket]] and Soviet [[Occupation of the Baltic states#Under Soviet rule 1944–1991|re-occupation of the Baltic States]].&lt;ref name=Muriev&gt;Д.

==Background==
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-244-2321-34, Ostfront-Süd, Panzer V (Panther).jpg|thumb|Panther on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], 1944.]]
In 1944, the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' was pressed back along its entire frontline in the east. In February 1944, it retreated from the approaches to [[Leningrad]] to the prepared section of the [[Panther Line]] at the border of [[Estonia]]. In June and July, Army Group Centre was thrown back from the [[Belorussian SSR]] into [[Poland]] by [[Operation Bagration]]. This created the opportunity for the Red Army to attack towards the [[Baltic Sea]], thereby severing the land connection between the German Army Groups.

By 5 July, the [[Šiauliai Offensive]] commenced, as a follow-on from Operation Bagration. The  Soviet 43rd, [[51st Army (Soviet Union)|51st]], and [[Soviet Second Guards Army|2nd Guards]] Armies attacked towards [[Riga]] on the Baltic coast with [[3rd Guards Mechanized Corps]] in the van. By 31 July, the coast on the Gulf of Riga had been reached; [[6th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|6th Guards Army]] covered Riga and the extended flank of the penetration towards the north.

The German reaction was rapid, and initially successful. A counterattack, code-named [[Operation Doppelkopf]], was conducted on 16 August by [[XXXX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXX]] and [[XXXIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXIX]] Panzer Corps under the command of [[3rd Panzer Army|Third Panzer Army]], Army Group Centre. Acting in coordination with armored formations from Army Group North, they initially cut off the Soviet troops on the coast, and re-established a tenuous 30-kilometer-wide corridor connecting Army Groups Centre and North. The main objective of the attack was to retake the key road junction of [[Šiauliai]] ({{lang-de|Schaulen}}), but the German tanks ran head-on into an in-depth defense by the [[1st Baltic Front]], and by 20 August the German advance had stalled with heavy losses. A follow-on attack, code-named [[Operation Doppelkopf#Operation Cäsar|Operation Cäsar]], and launched on 16 September, failed in the same manner. After a brief period of respite, [[STAVKA]] issued orders for the Baltic Strategic Offensive, which lasted from 14 September-24 November.

==Battles==
In common with other Soviet strategic offensives, the Baltic Offensive covers a number of operational level operations and individual Front offensive operations:&lt;ref name=offensives&gt;See [http://www.soldat.ru/doc/casualties/book/chapter5_10_1.html soldat.ru] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505031426/http://www.soldat.ru/doc/casualties/book/chapter5_10_1.html |date=May 5, 2008}} for a breakdown of the strategic offensive&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Riga Offensive (1944)|Riga Offensive]] ({{lang-ru|Рижская наступательная операция}}) (14 September-24 October 1944) was carried out by the [[3rd Baltic Front|3rd]] and [[2nd Baltic Front]]s and cleared the eastern coast of the [[Gulf of Riga]].
*The [[Tallinn Offensive]] ({{lang-ru|Таллинская наступательная операция}}) (17–26 September 1944) was carried out by the [[Leningrad Front]] to drive German forces from mainland [[Estonia]].
*The [[Moonsund Landing Operation]] ({{lang-ru|Моонзундская десантная операция}}) (27 September-24 November 1944) was the amphibious landing on the Estonian islands of [[Hiiumaa]], [[Saaremaa]] and [[Muhu]], which block access to the Gulf of Riga. According to Soviet data Germany lost 7.000 dead soldiers and 700 captured.&lt;ref&gt;http://militarymaps.narod.ru/oper_1944.html#46&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Battle of Memel|Memel Offensive]] ({{lang-ru|Мемельская операция}})(5–22 October 1944) was an attack by the [[1st Baltic Front]] aimed at severing the connection between the German Army Groups Centre and North.

From the German defensive perspective, the period included the following operations:
*[[Operation Doppelkopf#Operation Cäsar|Operation Cäsar]], aimed at the restoration of contact between Army Groups Centre and North 16–21 September 1944;
*[[Operation Aster]] aimed at the evacuation of Army Group North from mainland Estonia 17–26 September 1944
*The [[Battle of Memel|siege of Memel]] 5–27 October 1944;
*Formation of the [[Courland Pocket]] 15–22 October 1944.

==Aftermath==
[[Image:RedArmy19Aug31Dec44.jpg|right|300px|Soviet Operations, 19 August-31 December 1944]]

===Soviet victory===
The Baltic Offensive operation resulted in the expulsion of [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces from [[Estonia]] and [[Lithuania]]. The Soviet fronts involved in the battle lost a total of ca. 280,000 men to all causes (killed, missing, wounded, sick).

Communication lines between [[Army Group North]] and [[Army Group Centre]] were permanently severed, and the former was relegated to an occupied Baltic seashore area in Latvia. On 25 January, [[Adolf Hitler]] renamed Army Group North to [[Army Group Courland]] implicitly recognising that there was no possibility of restoring a new land corridor between [[Courland]] and [[East Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;On 25 January, Hitler renamed three army groups: [[Army Group North]] became [[Army Group Courland]]; [[Army Group Centre]] became Army Group North and [[Army Group A]] became [[Army Group Centre]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Army commenced the encirclement and reduction of the [[Courland Pocket|Courland cauldron]] which retained a possibility of being a major threat, but were able to focus on operations on its northern flank that were now aiming at East Prussia. Operations by the Red Army against the [[Courland Pocket]] continued until the surrender of the [[Army Group Courland]] on 9 May 1945, when close to 200,000 Germans were taken prisoner there.

The German command released thousands of native conscripts from military service. However the Soviet command began conscripting Baltic natives as areas were brought under Soviet control.&lt;ref name=Muriev/&gt; While some ended up serving on both sides, many partisans hid in the woods to avoid conscription. (''See also [[Forest Brothers]]'')

112 [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] awards were given out during the offensive, of which three were given soldier's second award.&lt;ref&gt;http://hronos.km.ru/sobyt/1900sob/1944pribalt.html (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reoccupation of the Baltic states===
{{Main|Occupation of the Baltic states}}

Soviet rule of the Baltic states was re-established by force, and [[sovietisation]] followed, which was mostly carried out in 1944–1950. The forced [[Kolkhoz|collectivisation of agriculture]] began in 1947, and was completed after the [[Operation Priboi|mass deportation of civilians in March 1949]]. All private farms were confiscated, and farmers were made to join the collective farms. An armed [[resistance movement]] of '[[forest brothers]]' was active until the mass deportations. Tens of thousands participated or supported the movement; thousands were killed. The Soviet authorities fighting the forest brothers suffered also hundreds of deaths. Among those killed on both sides were innocent civilians. Besides the armed resistance of the forest brothers, a number of underground nationalist schoolchildren groups were active. Most of their members were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. The punitive actions decreased rapidly after [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death in 1953; from 1956–1958, a large part of the deportees and political prisoners were allowed to return to their homelands. Political arrests and numerous other kind of [[crimes against humanity]] were committed all through the occupation period until the late 1980s. Although the armed resistance was defeated, the populations remained anti-Soviet. This helped the Baltic citizens to organise a [[Singing revolution|new resistance movement]] in the late 1980s and then rapidly develop a modern society after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Phase III: [http://www.mnemosyne.ee/hc.ee/pdf/conclusions_en_1944-.pdf The Soviet Occupation of Estonia from 1944].
