The '''Battle of Iwo Jima''' (19 February – 26 March 1945) was a major battle in which the United States Marine Corps and Navy landed on and eventually captured the island of [[Iwo Jima]] from the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) during [[World War II]]. The American invasion, designated '''Operation Detachment''', had the goal of capturing the entire island, including the three Japanese-controlled airfields (including the [[South Field (Iwo Jima)|South Field]] and the [[North Field (Iwo Jima)|Central Field]]), to provide a staging area for attacks on the Japanese main islands.&lt;ref name="morison"/&gt; This five-week battle comprised some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the [[Pacific War]] of World War II.

After the heavy losses incurred in the battle, the strategic value of the island became controversial. It was useless to the U.S. Army as a staging base and useless to the U.S. Navy as a fleet base.&lt;ref name= Newsweek_Pratt_19450402/&gt; However, Navy [[Seabee]]s rebuilt the landing strips, which were used as occasional landing strips for USAAF [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]], although rarely for emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/bib/42972|title=John Clements Collection|work=loc.gov|access-date=28 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402130836/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/vhp/bib/42972|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IJA positions on the island were heavily [[Fortification|fortified]], with a dense network of [[bunker]]s, hidden [[artillery]] positions, and {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} of tunnels.&lt;ref name=WW2MMDb_Letters&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwar2database.com/html/letters_from_iwo_jima.htm |title=Letters from Iwo Jima |publisher=World War II Multimedia Database |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212233438/http://worldwar2database.com/html/letters_from_iwo_jima.htm |archive-date=12 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BattleFleet_IwoDefense&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.battle-fleet.com/pw/his/Battle-Iwo-Jima-Defense.htm|title=Battle of Iwo Jima – Japanese Defense|work=World War II Naval Strategy|access-date=17 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417082049/http://www.battle-fleet.com/pw/his/Battle-Iwo-Jima-Defense.htm|archive-date=17 April 2016|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American ground forces were supported by extensive [[naval artillery]], and had complete [[air supremacy]] provided by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviators throughout the battle.&lt;ref&gt;

Japanese combat deaths numbered three times the number of American deaths although, uniquely among Pacific War Marine battles, American total casualties (dead and wounded) exceeded those of the Japanese.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite web|first=Cyril J.|last=O'Brien|title=Iwo Jima Retrospective|url=http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,NI_Iwo_Jima2,00.html|access-date=21 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607061101/http://www.military.com/NewContent/0%2C13190%2CNI_Iwo_Jima2%2C00.html|archive-date=7 June 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle, only 216 were taken prisoner, some of whom were captured because they had been knocked unconscious or otherwise disabled.&lt;ref name= Burrell83&gt;Burrell 2006, p. 83.

Burrell puts the range between 18,060 and 18,600, with exactly 216 of these taken prisoner during the course of the battle. Another 867 prisoners were taken by the U.S. Army between April and June, after the Marines had left.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the remainder were killed in action, although it has been estimated that as many as 3,000 continued to resist within the various cave systems for many days afterwards, eventually succumbing to their injuries or surrendering weeks later.&lt;ref name=Burrell83/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Toland, ''Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936–1945'', p. 669&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the bloody fighting and severe casualties on both sides, the American victory was assured from the start. Overwhelming American superiority in numbers and arms as well as complete [[air supremacy]]—coupled with the impossibility of Japanese retreat or reinforcement, along with sparse food and supplies—permitted no plausible circumstance in which the Americans could have lost the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian R.

==Background==

[[File:Iwo jima location mapSagredo.png|thumb|left|Location of Iwo Jima]]

After the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|American capture of the Marshall Islands]], and the devastating [[Operation Hailstone|air attacks]] against the Japanese fortress island of [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk Atoll]] in the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] in January 1944, the Japanese military leaders reevaluated their situation. All indications pointed to an American drive toward the [[Mariana Islands]] and the Carolines. To counter such an offensive, the IJA and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) established an inner line of defenses extending generally northward from the Carolines to the Marianas, and thence to Japan via the [[Volcano Islands]], and westward from the Marianas via the Carolines and the [[Palau Islands]] to [[the Philippines]].

In March 1944, the [[Thirty-First Army (Japan)|Japanese 31st Army]], commanded by General [[Hideyoshi Obata]], was activated to garrison this inner line. (Note that a Japanese army was about the size of an American, [[British Army]], or [[Canadian Army]] [[corps]]. The Japanese Army had many [[Armies of the Imperial Japanese Army#Armies|armies]], but the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] only had [[Formations of the United States Army during World War II#Field Armies|ten]] at its peak, with the 4th Army, the 6th Army, the 8th Army, and the 10th Army being in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]]. Also, the 10th Army only fought on [[Okinawa]] in the spring of 1945.)

The commander of the Japanese garrison on [[Chichi Jima]] was placed nominally in command of Army and Navy units in the [[Volcano Islands]].&lt;ref name="morison"/&gt; After the American conquest of the Marianas, daily bomber raids from the Marianas hit the mainland as part of [[Operation Scavenger]]. Iwo Jima served as an early warning station that radioed reports of incoming bombers back to mainland Japan. This allowed Japanese air defenses to prepare for the arrival of American bombers.&lt;ref name="morison"/&gt;

After the U.S. seized bases in the Marshall Islands in the battles of [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] and [[Battle of Eniwetok|Eniwetok]] in February 1944, Japanese Army and Navy reinforcements were sent to Iwo Jima: 500 men from the naval base at [[Yokosuka]] and 500 from Chichi Jima reached Iwo Jima during March and April 1944. At the same time, with reinforcements arriving from Chichi Jima and the home islands, the Army garrison on Iwo Jima reached a strength of more than 5,000 men.&lt;ref name= "morison"/&gt; The loss of the Marianas during the summer of 1944 greatly increased the importance of the Volcano Islands for the Japanese, who were afraid that the loss of these islands would facilitate American air raids against the Home Islands, disrupting war manufacturing and severely damaging civilian morale.&lt;ref name="morison"/&gt;

Final Japanese plans for the defense of the Volcano Islands were overshadowed by several factors:

# The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had already lost almost all of its power, and it could not prevent American landings.
# Aircraft losses in 1944 had been so heavy that, even if war production were not affected by American air attacks, combined Japanese air strength was not expected to increase to 3,000 [[warplane]]s until March or April 1945.
# These aircraft could not be used from bases in the Home Islands against Iwo Jima because their range was not more than {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}}.
# Available warplanes had to be hoarded to defend [[Taiwan]] and the [[Japan|Japanese Home Islands]] from any attack.&lt;ref name="morison"/&gt;
# There was a serious shortage of properly trained and experienced [[aviator|pilots]] and other aircrew to man the warplanes Japan had because such large numbers of pilots and crewmen had perished fighting over the [[Solomon Islands]] and during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in mid-1944.

In a postwar study, Japanese staff officers described the strategy that was used in the defense of Iwo Jima in the following terms:

{{quotation|In the light of the above situation, seeing that it was impossible to conduct our air, sea, and ground/ operations on Iwo Island [Jima] toward ultimate victory, it was decided that to gain time necessary for the preparation of the Homeland defense, our forces should rely solely upon the established defensive equipment in that area, checking the enemy by delaying tactics. Even the [[kamikaze|suicidal attacks]] by small groups of our Army and Navy airplanes, the surprise attacks by our [[submarine]]s, and the actions of parachute units, although effective, could be regarded only as a strategical ruse on our part. It was a most depressing thought that we had no available means left for the exploitation of the strategical opportunities which might from time to time occur in the course of these operations.&lt;ref&gt;USA, FEC, HistDiv, "Operations in the Central Pacific" – Japanese Studies in World War II (Japanese Monograph No. 48, OCMH), p. 62.; cited in George W. Garand and Truman R. Strobridge (1971).

At the end of the [[Battle of Leyte]] in the [[Philippines]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were left with a two-month lull in their offensive operations before the planned [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]]. Iwo Jima was considered strategically important: it provided an [[air base]] for Japanese [[Fighter aircraft|fighter planes]] to intercept long-range [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 Superfortress]] bombers. In addition, it was used by the Japanese to stage nuisance [[Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands|air attacks on the Mariana Islands]] from November 1944 through January 1945. The capture of Iwo Jima would eliminate these problems. The base would be available for [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]] fighters to escort and protect the bombers.&lt;ref name="morison"/&gt; In the end, none of these strategic reasons for the operation were valid.

American intelligence sources were confident that Iwo Jima would fall in one week. In light of the optimistic intelligence reports, the decision was made to invade Iwo Jima and the operation was given the code name Operation Detachment.&lt;ref name="morison"/&gt; American forces failed to anticipate that the Japanese would prepare a complex and deep defense, much like on Peleliu in the fall of 1944. So successful was the Japanese preparation that it was discovered after the battle that the hundreds of tons of Allied bombs and thousands of rounds of heavy naval gunfire had left the Japanese defenders almost undamaged and ready to inflict losses on the U.S. Marines.

==Planning and preparation==
{{Main|Planning for the Battle of Iwo Jima}}

===Japanese preparations===
[[File:Tadamichi Kuribayashi.jpg|upright|thumb|Lieut. Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi]]
By June 1944, Lieutenant General [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]] was assigned to command the defense of Iwo Jima. Kuribayashi knew that Japan could not win the battle, but he hoped to inflict massive casualties on the American forces, so that the United States and its Australian and British allies would reconsider carrying out [[Operation Downfall|the invasion of Japan Home Islands]].

While drawing inspiration from the defense in the [[Battle of Peleliu]], Kuribayashi designed a defense that broke with Japanese military doctrine. Rather than establishing his defenses on the beach to face the landings directly, he created strong, mutually supporting [[defense in depth|defenses in depth]] using static and heavy weapons such as heavy [[machine gun]]s and artillery. [[Takeichi Nishi]]'s armored [[tank]]s were to be used as camouflaged artillery positions. Because the tunnel linking the mountain to the main forces was never completed, Kuribayashi organized the southern area of the island in and around [[Mount Suribachi]] as a semi-independent sector, with his main defensive zone built up in the north. The expected American naval and air bombardment further prompted the creation of an extensive system of tunnels that connected the prepared positions, so that a [[pillbox (military)|pillbox]] that had been cleared could be reoccupied. This network of [[bunker]]s and pillboxes favored the defense. For instance, The Nano Bunker (Southern Area Islands Naval Air HQ), which was located east of Airfield Number 2, had enough food, water, and ammunition for the Japanese to hold out for three months. The bunker was 90 feet deep and had tunnels running in various directions. Approximately 500 55-gallon drums filled with water, kerosene, and fuel oil for generators were located inside the complex. Gasoline-powered generators allowed for radios and lighting to be operated underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Tomb Called Iwo Jima|last=King|first=Dan|publisher=Pacific Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1500343385|location=|pages=58–59|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 19, 1945, the day the Americans invaded, {{convert|18|km|mi}} of a planned {{convert|27|km|mi}} of tunnel network had been dug. Besides the Nanpo Bunker, there were numerous command centers and barracks that were 75 feet deep. Tunnels allowed for troop movement to go undetected to various defense positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Iwo Jima|last=Hammel|first=Eric|publisher=Zenith Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7603-3733-2|location=Minneapolis|pages=36|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of hidden artillery and mortar positions along with [[land mine]]s were placed all over the island. Among the Japanese weapons were [[320 mm Type 98 mortar|320 mm spigot mortars]] and a variety of explosive [[rocket]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Tomb Called Iwo Jima|last=King|first=Dan|publisher=Pacific Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-5003-43385|location=|pages=80|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, the Japanese supply was inadequate. Troops were supplied 60% of the standard issue of ammunition sufficient for one engagement by one division, and food and forage for four months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/Japan/Monos/JM-45/ |title=History of Imperial General Headquarters Army Section, p. 257 |access-date=31 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406174019/http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/Japan/Monos/JM-45/ |archive-date=6 April 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous Japanese snipers and camouflaged machine gun positions were also set up. Kuribayashi specially engineered the defenses so that every part of Iwo Jima was subject to Japanese defensive fire. He also received a handful of ''[[kamikaze]]'' pilots to use against the enemy fleet. Three hundred and eighteen American sailors were killed by ''kamikaze'' attacks during the battle. However, against his wishes, Kuribayashi's superiors on [[Honshu]] ordered him to erect some beach defenses.

===American preparations===

Starting on 15 June 1944, the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] began [[naval bombardment]]s and [[aerial bomb|air raids]] against Iwo Jima, which would become the longest and most intense in the Pacific theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronology of the Battle of Iwo Jima |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/pactheatercamp/iwo/chronology.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707082542/http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/pactheatercamp/iwo/chronology.htm |archive-date=7 July 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These would contain a combination of [[naval artillery]] shellings and [[strategic bombing|aerial bombings]] that went on for nine months. On 17 February, the [[destroyer escort]] {{USS|Blessman|DE-69|6}} sent [[Underwater Demolition Team]] 15 (UDT-15) toward Blue Beach for reconnaissance. The Japanese [[infantry]] fired on them, killing one American diver. On the evening of 18 February, the ''Blessman'' was hit by a bomb from a Japanese aircraft, killing 40 sailors, including 15 members of her UDT.

Unaware of Kuribayashi's tunnel defense system, many of the Americans assumed the majority of the Japanese garrison were killed by the constant bombing raids.

===Pre-landing bombardment===
[[File:USS New York-11.jpg|thumb|The battleship {{USS|New York|BB-34|6}} firing its {{convert|14|in|mm|abbr=on}} main guns on the island, 16 February 1945 (D minus 3)]]
Maj. Gen. [[Harry Schmidt (USMC)|Harry Schmidt]], commander of the Marine landing force, requested a 10-day heavy shelling of the island immediately preceding the mid-February [[amphibious assault]]. However, Rear Adm. [[William H. P. Blandy]], commander of the Amphibious Support Force (Task Force 52), did not believe such a bombardment would allow him time to replenish his ships' ammunition before the landings; he thus refused Schmidt's request. Schmidt then asked for nine days of shelling; Blandy again refused and agreed to a three-day bombardment. This decision left much hard feelings among the Marines. After the war, Lieut. Gen. [[Holland Smith|Holland M. "Howlin' Mad" Smith]], commander Expeditionary Troops (Task Force 56, which consisted of Schmidt's Fifth Amphibious Corps), bitterly complained that the lack of naval gunfire had cost Marine lives during the entire Allied island campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Each heavy [[warship]] was given an area on which to fire that, combined with all the ships, covered the entire island. Each warship fired for approximately six hours before stopping for a certain amount of time. Poor weather on D minus 3 led to uncertain results for that day's bombardment. On D minus 2, the time and care that the Japanese had taken in preparing their artillery positions became clear. When [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS|Pensacola|CA-24|6}} got within range of shore batteries, the ship was quickly hit 6 times and suffered 17 crew deaths. Later, 12 small craft attempting to land an [[underwater demolition team]] were all struck by Japanese rounds and quickly retired. While aiding these vessels, the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Leutze|DD-481|6}} was also hit and suffered 7 crew deaths. On D minus 1, Adm. Blandy's gunners were once again hampered by rain and clouds. Gen. Schmidt summed up his feelings by saying, "We only got about 13 hours worth of fire support during the 34 hours of available daylight."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

The limited bombardment had questionable impact on the enemy due to the Japanese being heavily dug-in and fortified. However, many [[bunker]]s and caves were destroyed during the bombing, giving it some limited success. The Japanese had been preparing for this battle since March 1944, which gave them a significant head start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naval Gunfire|url=http://ftp.metalab.unc.edu/hyperwar/USN/rep/Iwo/Cominch/Iwo-2.html|accessdate=28 February 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the landing, about 450 American ships were located off Iwo Jima.

===Amphibious landing===
During the night, Vice Adm. [[Marc A. Mitscher|Marc A. Mitscher's]] Task Force 58, a huge carrier force, arrived off Iwo Jima. Also in this flotilla was Adm. [[Raymond A. Spruance]], overall commander for the invasion, in his flagship, the [[heavy cruiser]] {{USS |Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}. "Howlin' Mad" Smith was once again deeply frustrated that Mitscher's powerful carrier group had been bombing the Japanese home islands instead of softening up the defenses of Iwo Jima. Mitscher's fliers did contribute to the additional surface-ship bombardment that accompanied the formation of the amphibious craft.&lt;ref name="Wright, p. 23"&gt;Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the days of the pre-landing bombardment, D-Day dawned clear and bright.&lt;ref name="Wright, p. 23"/&gt; At 08:59, one minute ahead of schedule, the first wave of Marines landed on the beaches of the southeastern coast of Iwo Jima. Major Howard Connor, [[5th Marine Division]] signal officer, had six [[Navajo code talkers]] working around the clock during the first two days of the battle. These six sent and received over 800 messages, all without error. Connor later stated, "Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/code-talkers.html "Navajo Code Talkers: World War II Fact Sheet"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104121421/https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/code-talkers.html |date=4 November 2017 }}. [[Naval Historical Center]]. 1992. Retrieved 2014-03-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation on the beaches===
Unfortunately for the landing force, the planners at Pearl Harbor had completely misjudged the situation that would face Gen. Schmidt's Marines. The beaches had been described as "excellent" and the thrust inland was expected to be "easy." In reality, after crossing the beach, the Marines were faced with 15-foot-high slopes of soft black volcanic ash.&lt;ref name="Wright, p. 26"&gt;Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This ash allowed for neither a secure footing nor the construction of [[Defensive fighting position|foxholes]] to protect the Marines from hostile fire. However, the ash did help to absorb some of the [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragments]] from Japanese artillery.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

{{quote|Marines were trained to move rapidly forward; here they could only plod. The weight and amount of equipment was a terrific hindrance and various items were rapidly discarded. First to go was the gas mask&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="Wright, p. 26"/&gt;}}

The lack of a vigorous response led the Navy to conclude that their bombardment had suppressed the Japanese defenses and in good order the Marines began deployment to the Iwo Jima beach.&lt;ref name="Wright, p. 26"/&gt; Gen. Kuribayashi was far from beaten, however. In the deathly silence, landed US Marines began to slowly inch their way forward inland, oblivious to the danger. After allowing the Americans to pile up men and machinery on the beach for just over an hour, Kuribayashi unleashed the undiminished force of his countermeasures. Shortly after 10:00, everything from machine guns and mortars to heavy artillery began to rain down on the crowded beach, which was quickly transformed into a nightmarish bloodbath.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|At first it came as a ragged rattle of machine-gun bullets, growing gradually lower and fiercer until at last all the pent-up fury of a hundred hurricanes seemed to be breaking upon the heads of the Americans. Shells screeched and crashed, every hummock spat automatic fire and the very soft soil underfoot erupted underfoot with hundreds of exploding land mines&amp;nbsp;... Marines walking erect crumpled and fell. Concussion lifted them and slammed them down, or tore them apart&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, ''The Battle for Iwo Jima'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Time-Life'' correspondent [[Robert Sherrod]] described it simply as "a nightmare in hell."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese heavy artillery in Mount Suribachi opened their reinforced steel doors to fire, and then closed them immediately to prevent counterfire from the Marines and naval gunners. This made it difficult for American units to destroy a Japanese artillery piece.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; To make matters worse for the Americans, the bunkers were connected to the elaborate tunnel system so that bunkers that were cleared with [[flamethrower]]s and grenades were reoccupied shortly afterwards by Japanese troops moving through the tunnels. This tactic caused many casualties among the Marines, as they walked past the reoccupied bunkers without expecting to suddenly take fresh fire from them.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

===Moving off the beaches===
[[Amtrac]]s, unable to do more than uselessly churn the black ash, made no progress up the slopes; their Marine passengers had to dismount and slog forward on foot.&lt;ref&gt;Leckie, ''The Battle for Iwo Jima'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Men of the [[Seabee|Naval Construction Battalions]] 31 and 133, braving enemy fire, eventually were able to bulldoze roads off the beach. This allowed the Marines and equipment to finally make some progress inland and get off the jam-packed beaches. "Even so, in virtually every shell hole there lay at least one dead Marine&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Wright, p. 32"&gt;Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

By 11:30, some Marines had managed to reach the southern tip of Airfield No. 1, whose possession had been one of the (highly unrealistic) original American objectives for the first day. The Marines endured a fanatical 100-man charge by the Japanese, but were able to keep their toehold on Airfield No. 1 as night fell.&lt;ref name="Wright, p. 32"/&gt;

===Crossing the island===
In the left-most sector, the Americans did manage to achieve one of their objectives for the battle that day. Led by Col. [[Harry B. Liversedge|Harry B. "Harry the Horse" Liversedge]], the [[28th Marine Regiment|28th Marines]] drove across the island at its narrowest width, around {{convert|0.8|km|mi}}, thereby isolating the Japanese dug in on Mount Suribachi.

===Action on the right flank===
The right-most landing area was dominated by Japanese positions at the Quarry. The [[25th Marine Regiment]] undertook a two-pronged attack to silence these guns. Their experience can be summarized by the ordeal of 2nd Lt. Benjamin Roselle, part of a ground team directing naval gunfire:

{{quote|Within a minute a mortar shell exploded among the group&amp;nbsp;... his left foot and ankle hung from his leg, held on by a ribbon of flesh&amp;nbsp;... Within minutes a second round landed near him and fragments tore into his other leg. For nearly an hour he wondered where the next shell would land. He was soon to find out as a shell burst almost on top of him, wounding him for the third time in the shoulder. Almost at once another explosion bounced him several feet into the air and hot shards ripped into both thighs&amp;nbsp;... as he lifted his arm to look at his watch a mortar shell exploded only feet away and blasted the watch from his wrist and tore a large jagged hole in his forearm: "I was beginning to know what it must be like to be crucified," he was later to say.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[25th Marine Regiment|25th Marines']] 3rd Battalion had landed approximately 900 men in the morning. Japanese resistance at the Quarry was so fierce that by nightfall only 150 Marines were left in fighting condition, an 83.3% casualty rate.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

By the evening, 30,000 Marines had landed. About 40,000 more would follow.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; Aboard the command ship ''Eldorado'', "Howlin' Mad" Smith saw the lengthy casualty reports and heard of the slow progress of the ground forces. To the war correspondents covering the operation he confessed, "I don't know who he is, but the Japanese general running this show is one smart bastard."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ''Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent combat==
In the days after the landings, the Marines expected the usual Japanese [[Banzai charge|''banzai'' charge]] during the night. This had been the standard Japanese final defense strategy in previous battles against enemy ground forces in the Pacific, such as during the [[Battle of Saipan]]. In those attacks, for which the Marines were prepared, the majority of the Japanese attackers had been killed and the Japanese strength greatly reduced. However, General Kuribayashi had strictly forbidden these "[[human wave]]" attacks by the Japanese infantrymen because he considered them to be futile.&lt;ref name= Allen/&gt;

The fighting on the beachhead at Iwo Jima was very fierce. The advance of the Marines was stalled by numerous defensive positions augmented by artillery pieces. There, the Marines were ambushed by Japanese troops who occasionally sprang out of tunnels. At night, the Japanese left their defenses under cover of darkness to attack American foxholes, but U.S. Navy ships fired star shells to deny them the cover of darkness. On Iwo Jima (and other Japanese held islands), Japanese soldiers who knew English were used to harass and or deceive Marines in order to kill them if they could; they would yell "corpsman" pretending to be a wounded Marine, in order to lure in U.S. Navy medical corpsmen attached to Marine infantry companies.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

The Marines learned that firearms were relatively ineffective against the Japanese defenders and effectively used flamethrowers and grenades to flush out Japanese troops in the tunnels. One of the technological innovations of the battle, the eight [[M4 Sherman|Sherman M4A3R3]] medium tanks [[Flame tank|equipped with a flamethrower]] ("Ronson" or "Zippo" tanks), proved very effective at clearing Japanese positions. The Shermans were difficult to disable, such that defenders were often compelled to assault them in the open, where they would fall victim to the superior numbers of Marines.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

[[Close air support]] was initially provided by fighters from [[escort carrier]]s off the coast. This shifted over to the [[15th Fighter Group]], flying P-51 Mustangs, after they arrived on the island on 6 March. Similarly, illumination rounds (flares) which were used to light up the battlefield at night were initially provided by ships, shifting over later to landing force artillery. Navajo [[code talker]]s were part of the American ground communications, along with [[walkie-talkie]]s and [[SCR-610]] backpack radio sets.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

After running out of water, food and most supplies, the Japanese troops became desperate toward the end of the battle. Kuribayashi, who had argued against banzai attacks at the start of the battle, realized that defeat was imminent.

Marines began to face increasing numbers of nighttime attacks; these were only repelled by a combination of machine-gun defensive positions and artillery support. At times, the Marines engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to repel the Japanese attacks.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; With the landing area secure, more troops and heavy equipment came ashore, and the invasion proceeded north to capture the airfields and the remainder of the island. Most Japanese soldiers fought to the death.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

==Raising the flag on Mt. Suribachi==
{{Main|Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima}}
[[File:Stars and Stripes on Mount Suribachi (Iwo Jima).jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. flag over Mount Suribachi]]
[[File:3c-Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. postage stamp, 1945 issue, commemorating the Battle of Iwo Jima]]

"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima" is a black and white photograph taken by [[Joe Rosenthal]] depicting six Marines from E Company, [[2nd Battalion 28th Marines|2nd Battalion, 28th Marines]], raising a [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945,&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt; which was the second of two flag-raisings on the site that day. The photograph was extremely popular, being reprinted in thousands of publications. Later, it became the only photograph to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Photography]] in the same year as its publication, and ultimately came to be regarded as one of the most significant and recognizable images of the war, and possibly the most reproduced photograph of all time.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt; The flag raising picture was later used by [[Felix de Weldon]] to sculpt the [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] which is located adjacent to [[Arlington National Cemetery]] since 1954.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;

Three of the six Marines depicted in the photograph, Sergeant [[Michael Strank]], Corporal [[Harlon Block]], and Private First Class [[Franklin Sousley]], were killed in action days after the flag-raising. Surviving flag-raiser Private First Class [[Ira Hayes]], together with Private First Class [[Rene Gagnon]] and [[Hospital corpsman|Navy corpsman]] [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]], became celebrities upon their participation in a war bond selling tour after the battle; three subsequent Marine Corps investigations into the identities of the six men in the photograph determined: in 1946 and 1947, that [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]] was incorrectly identified as being Harlon Block (both were killed six days after the photo was taken), in May and June 2016, that John Bradley was not in the photograph and Pfc. [[Harold Schultz]] was,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624115022/http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ |date=24 June 2016 }}, Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2019, that  Rene Gagnon was not in the photograph and Private First Class [[Harold Keller]] was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Warrior in iconic Iwo Jima flag-raising photo was misidentified, Marines Corps acknowledges|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/warrior-iconic-iwo-jima-flag-raising-photo-was-misidentified-marines-n1064766|publisher=NBC News|date=2019-10-16|accessdate=2020-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the morning of 23 February, Mount Suribachi was effectively cut off above ground from the rest of the island. The Marines knew that the Japanese defenders had an extensive network of below-ground defenses, and that in spite of its isolation above ground, the volcano was still connected to Japanese defenders via the tunnel network. They expected a fierce fight for the summit. Two small patrols from two rifle companies from the 2/28 Marines were sent up the volcano to reconnoiter routes on the mountain's north face. The recon patrols made it to the summit and scrambled down again, reporting any contact to the 2/28 Marines commander, Colonel Chandler Johnson.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Robert E.|year=2004|title=The First Battalion of the 28th Marines on Iwo Jima: A Day-by-Day History from Personal Accounts and Official Reports, with Complete Muster Rolls|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=0-7864-0560-0| oclc=41157682}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular accounts embroidered by the press in the aftermath of the release of the photo of the flag raising, had the Marines fighting all the way up to the summit. Although the Marine riflemen expected an ambush, the larger patrol going up afterwards encountered a few Japanese defenders once on top and after the flag was raised. The majority of the Japanese troops stayed in the tunnel network due to U.S. shelling, only occasionally attacking in small groups, and were generally all killed. Johnson called for a reinforced platoon size patrol from E Company to climb Suribachi and seize and occupy the crest. The patrol commander, 1st Lt. [[Harold G. Schrier|Harold Schrier]], was handed the battalion's American flag to be raised on top to signal Suribachi's capture, if they reached the summit. Johnson and the Marines anticipated heavy fighting, but the patrol encountered only a small amount of sniper fire on the way up the mountain. Once the top was secured by Schrier and his men, a length of Japanese water pipe was found there among the wreckage, and the American flag was attached to the pipe and then raised and planted on top of Mount Suribachi which became the first foreign flag to fly on Japanese soil.&lt;ref name= LAT_20070626&gt;{{cite news|access-date=30 November 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/26/local/me-lindberg26|title=Charles Lindberg, 86; Marine helped raise first U.S. flag over Iwo Jima|date=26 June 2007|page=B8|work=The Los Angeles Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022152425/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/26/local/me-lindberg26|archive-date=22 October 2012|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of the flag and some of the patrol members around it were taken by Marine photographer [[Louis R. Lowery]], the only photographer who had accompanied Lt. Schrier's patrol up the mountain.

As the flag went up, Secretary of the Navy [[James Forrestal]] had just landed on the beach at the foot of Mount Suribachi and decided that he wanted the flag as a souvenir. Colonel Johnson, the battalion's commander, believed that the flag belonged to the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, who had captured that section of the island. In the early afternoon, Johnson sent Pfc. Rene Gagnon, a runner (messenger) from his battalion for E Company, to take a larger flag up the volcano to replace the smaller and less visible flag. The replacement flag was attached to another and heavier section of water pipe and six Marines proceeded to raise it into place as the smaller flag was taken down and delivered to the battalion's headquarters down below. It was during this ''second'' flag-raising that Joseph Rosenthal took his exceptionally famous photograph ''Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima''. The second flag flew on Mount Suribachi until it was taken down on March 14, when at the same time an American flag was officially raised up a flagpole during a ceremony at the [[V Amphibious Corps]] command post near Mount Suribachi which was ordered by Lt. Gen. [[Holland Smith]] the commander of all the troops on Iwo Jima. Major General [[Graves B. Erskine]], the commander of the [[3rd Marine Division]] was also at the event with other troops of the division.

Despite Japan's loss of Mount Suribachi on the south end of the island, the Japanese still held strong positions on the north end. The rocky terrain vastly favored defense, even more so than Mount Suribachi, which was much easier to hit with naval artillery fire. Coupled with this, the fortifications constructed by Kuribayashi were more impressive than at the southern end of the island.&lt;ref name="Wheeler 1979"&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith |last=Wheeler |title=The Road to Tokyo |url=https://archive.org/details/roadtotokyo0000whee |url-access=limited |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1979 |location=Alexandria, VA |page=[https://archive.org/details/roadtotokyo0000whee/page/50 50] |isbn=0-8094-2540-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining under the command of Kuribayashi was the equivalent of eight infantry battalions, a tank regiment, and two artillery and three heavy mortar battalions. There were also about 5,000 gunners and naval infantry. The most arduous task left to the Marines was the overtaking of the Motoyama Plateau with its distinctive Hill 382 and Turkey knob and the area in between referred to as the Amphitheater. This formed the basis of what came to be known as the "meatgrinder". While this was being achieved on the right flank, the left was clearing out Hill 362 with just as much difficulty. The overall objective at this point was to take control of Airfield No. 2 in the center of the island. However, every "penetration seemed to become a disaster" as "units were raked from the flanks, chewed up, and sometimes wiped out. Tanks were destroyed by interlocking fire or were hoisted into the air on the spouting fireballs of buried mines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Leckie |title=Delivered from Evil |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1987 |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/deliveredfromevi00leck/page/870 870] |isbn=0-06-091535-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/deliveredfromevi00leck/page/870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the fighting bogged down, with American casualties piling up. Even capturing these points was not a solution to the problem since a previously secured position could be attacked from the rear by the use of the tunnels and hidden pillboxes. As such, it was said that "they could take these heights at will, and then regret it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Leckie |title=Delivered from Evil |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1987 |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/deliveredfromevi00leck/page/871 871] |isbn=0-06-091535-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/deliveredfromevi00leck/page/871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marines nevertheless found ways to prevail under the circumstances. It was observed that during bombardments, the Japanese would hide their guns and themselves in the caves only to reappear when the troops would advance and lay devastating fire on them. The Japanese had over time learned basic American strategy, which was to lay heavy bombardment before an infantry attack. Consequently, General Erskine ordered the [[9th Marine Regiment (United States)|9th Marine Regiment]] to attack under the cover of darkness with no preliminary barrage. This came to be a resounding success with many Japanese soldiers killed while still asleep. This was a key moment in the capture of Hill 362.&lt;ref name="Robert Leckie, p.872"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Leckie |title=Delivered from Evil |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1987 |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/deliveredfromevi00leck/page/872 872] |isbn=0-06-091535-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/deliveredfromevi00leck/page/872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It held such importance that the Japanese organized a counterattack the following night. Although Kuribayashi had forbidden the suicide charges familiar with other battles in the Pacific, the commander of the area decided on a ''banzai'' charge with the optimistic goal of recapturing Mount Suribachi. On the evening of 8 March, Captain Samaji Inouye and his 1,000 men charged the American lines, inflicting 347 casualties (90 deaths). The Marines counted 784 dead Japanese soldiers the next day.&lt;ref name="Wheeler 1979" /&gt; The same day, elements of the 3rd Marine Division reached the northern coast of the island, splitting Kuribayashi's defenses in two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_iwojima.html#d18 |title=Operation Detachment: The Battle for Iwo Jima February – March 1945 |publisher=historyofwar.org |access-date=17 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215091545/http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_iwojima.html#d18 |archive-date=15 February 2009 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a ''kamikaze'' air attack (the only one of the battle) on the ships anchored at sea on 21 February, which resulted in the sinking of the escort carrier {{USS|Bismarck Sea|CVE-95|6}}, severe damage to {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}, and slight damage to the escort carrier {{USS|Lunga Point||6}}, an LST, and a transport.&lt;ref name="Robert Leckie, p.872"/&gt;

Although the island was declared secure at 18:00 on 16 March (25 days after the landings), the 5th Marine Division still faced Kuribayashi's stronghold in a gorge {{convert|640|m|yd|abbr=on}} long at the northwestern end of the island. On 21 March, the Marines destroyed the command post in the gorge with four tons of explosives and on 24 March, Marines sealed the remaining caves at the northern tip of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moskin|pp=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the night of 25 March, a 300-man Japanese force launched a final [[counterattack]] in the vicinity of Airfield No. 2. Army pilots, [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabees]], and Marines of the 5th Pioneer Battalion and [[28th Marine Regiment|28th Marines]] fought the Japanese force for up to 90 minutes, suffering heavy casualties (53 killed, 120 wounded).{{citation needed|date=January 2009}} Although still a matter of speculation because of conflicting accounts from surviving Japanese veterans, it has been said that Kuribayashi led this final assault,&lt;ref name="morison"/&gt; which unlike the loud ''banzai'' charge of previous battles, was characterized as a silent attack. If ever proven true, Kuribayashi would have been the highest ranking Japanese officer to have personally led an attack during World War II.{{fact|date=June 2020}} Additionally, this would also be Kuribayashi's final act, a departure from the normal practice of the commanding Japanese officers committing [[seppuku]] behind the lines while the rest perished in the ''banzai'' charge, as happened during the battles of [[Saipan]] and [[Okinawa]]. The island was officially declared secure at 09:00 on 26 March.{{fact|date=June 2020}}

Once the island was officially declared secure, the Army's 147th Infantry Regiment was ostensibly there to act as a garrison force, but they soon found themselves locked in a bitter struggle against thousands of stalwart defenders engaging in a last-ditch [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign to harass the Americans.&lt;ref name="theamericanwarrior.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://theamericanwarrior.com/2015/12/06/the-curious-case-of-the-ohio-national-guards-147th-infantry/ |title=The Curious Case of the Ohio National Guard's 147th Infantry |date=6 December 2015 |access-date=26 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003162404/https://theamericanwarrior.com/2015/12/06/the-curious-case-of-the-ohio-national-guards-147th-infantry/ |archive-date=3 October 2016 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using well-supplied caves and tunnel systems, the Japanese resisted American advances. For three months, the 147th slogged across the island, using [[flamethrower]]s, [[grenade]]s, and [[satchel charge]]s to dig out the enemy, killing some 1,602 Japanese soldiers in small unit actions.{{fact|date=June 2020}}

==Weapons==
[[File:Flamethrower-iwo-jima-194502.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A flamethrower operator of E Company, [[2nd Battalion 9th Marines]], [[3rd Marine Division]], runs under fire on Iwo Jima.]]

The United States [[M2 flamethrower]] was heavily used in the Pacific. It features two tanks containing fuel and compressed gas respectively, which are combined and ignited to produce a stream of flaming liquid out of the tip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flamethrower|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/militaryhistory/collection/object.asp?ID=246|access-date=28 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628182414/http://americanhistory.si.edu/militaryhistory/collection/object.asp?ID=246|archive-date=28 June 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These flamethrowers were used to kill Japanese holed into pillboxes, buildings and caves. A battalion would assign one flamethrower per platoon with one reserve flamethrower in each group. Flamethrower operators were usually in more danger than regular troops as the short range of their weapon required close combat, and the visibility of the flames on the battlefield made them a prominent target for snipers. Still they were essential to breaking the enemy and one battalion commander called the flamethrower the "best single weapon of the operation."&lt;ref name="history.army.mil"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Flame Thrower in the Pacific: Marianas to Okinawa|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/chemsincmbt/ch15.htm|access-date=28 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314074743/http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/chemsincmbt/ch15.htm|archive-date=14 March 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ronson flame tank Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|March 1945 Several [[M4 Sherman|M4A3 Sherman]] tanks equipped with flamethrowers were used to clear Japanese bunkers.]]
Marines later experimented putting flamethrowers on tanks which were also deployed during battle. Their effectiveness was more limited due to Iwo Jima's rough terrain. A flamethrower tank would have a range of approximately {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on|-1}}, carry {{convert|300|USgal|l}} of fuel and have a firing time of 150 seconds.&lt;ref name="history.army.mil"/&gt;

Though ultimately victorious, the American victory at Iwo Jima had come at a terrible price. According to the official Navy Department Library website, "The 36-day (Iwo Jima) assault resulted in more than 26,000 American casualties, including 6,800 dead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/battleiwojima.htm |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100407193611/http%3A//history%2Enavy%2Emil/library/online/battleiwojima%2Ehtm |archivedate= 7 April 2010 |title=Battle for Iwo Jima, 1945 |publisher=[[Navy Department Library]] |date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, the much larger scale 82-day [[Battle of Okinawa]] lasting from early April until mid-June 1945 (involving five U.S. Army and two Marine Corps divisions) resulted in over 62,000 U.S. casualties, of whom over 12,000 were killed or missing. Iwo Jima was also the only U.S. Marine battle where the American casualties exceeded the Japanese,&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt; although Japanese combat deaths numbered three times as many as American deaths.

In hindsight, given the number of casualties, the necessity and long-term significance of the island's capture to the outcome of the war became a contentious issue and remains disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/LUTZ/iwo.html |title=The Battle of Iwo Jima |publisher=History Department at the University of San Diego |access-date=10 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720132646/https://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/LUTZ/iwo.html |archive-date=20 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marines, who suffered the actual casualties, were not consulted in the planning of the operation.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |first=Robert S. |last=Burrell |title=Breaking the cycle of Iwo Jima mythology: a strategic study of Operation Detachment |journal=[[Journal of Military History]] |year=2004 |volume=68 |issue=4 |pages=1143–1186 |doi=10.1353/jmh.2004.0175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as April 1945, retired Chief of Naval Operations [[William V. Pratt]] stated in ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine that considering the "expenditure of manpower to acquire a small, God-forsaken island, useless to the Army as a staging base and useless to the Navy as a fleet base&amp;nbsp;... [one] wonders if the same sort of airbase could not have been reached by acquiring other strategic localities at lower cost."&lt;ref name= Newsweek_Pratt_19450402&gt;{{cite news|first=William V.|last=Pratt|authorlink=William Veazie Pratt| title=What Makes Iwo Jima Worth the Price|work=Newsweek|date=2 April 1945|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lessons learned on Iwo Jima served as guidelines for the following [[Battle of Okinawa]] and the [[Operation Downfall|planned invasion of the Japanese homeland]]. For example, "because of the casualties taken at Iwo Jima on the first day, it was decided to make the preparatory bombardment the heaviest yet delivered on to a Pacific island".&lt;ref&gt;John Keegan, ''The Second World War''.  Penguin books, 1989, p. 566&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the planning for a potential attack on the Japanese home islands, it was taken into account that around a third of the troops committed to Iwo Jima and again at Okinawa had been killed or wounded.&lt;ref&gt;John Keegan, p. 575&lt;/ref&gt;

The justification for Iwo Jima's strategic importance to the United States' war effort has been that it provided a landing and refueling site for long-range fighter escorts. These escorts proved both impractical and unnecessary, and only ten such missions were ever flown from Iwo Jima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Assistant Chief of Air Staff|title=Iwo, B-29 Haven and Fighter Springboard|work=Impact|date=September–October 1945| pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Iwo Jima had been captured, the bombing campaign against Japan had switched from daylight precision bombing to nighttime incendiary attacks, so fighter escorts were of limited utility.&lt;ref name="navytimes19feb20"&gt;[https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2020/02/20/what-if-the-navy-and-marine-corps-had-bypassed-iwo-jima/ What if the Navy and Marine Corps had bypassed Iwo Jima?]. ''[[Navy Times]]''. 19 February 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese fighter aircraft based on Iwo Jima sometimes attacked AAF planes, which were vulnerable on their way to Japan because they were heavily laden with bombs and fuel. However, although some Japanese interceptors were based on Iwo Jima, their impact on the American bombing effort was marginal; in the three months before the invasion only 11 B-29s were lost as a result.&lt;ref name=Craven1953&gt;{{cite book| last=Craven|first=Wesley Frank|author2=James Lea Cate|title=The Army Air Forces in World War II| url=https://archive.org/details/armyairforcesinw07unit| year=1953|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|oclc=704158|pages=5:581–582| isbn=0-226-11995-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Superfortresses found it unnecessary to make any major detour around the island.&lt;ref&gt;Craven and Cate, 5:559.&lt;/ref&gt; Capturing the island neutralized Japanese air attacks based from it on the Marianas, but they were too small to ever launch significant attacks.&lt;ref name="navytimes19feb20"/&gt;
[[File:24th marines wwii iwo jima.jpg|thumb|Marines from the 24th Marine Regiment during the Battle of Iwo Jima]]

The Japanese on Iwo Jima had [[radar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newcomb|first=Richard F.|title=Iwo Jima |publisher=Holt Paperbacks|year=2002|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iPvmNzkuLn4C&amp;pg=PA59| isbn=0-8050-7071-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were thus able to notify their comrades at home of incoming B-29 Superfortresses flying from the [[Mariana Islands]]. However, the capture of Iwo Jima did not affect the Japanese early-warning radar system, which continued to receive information on incoming B-29s from the island of [[Rota (island)|Rota]] (which was never invaded).&lt;ref&gt;Joint War Planning Committee 306/1, "Plan for the Seizure of Rota Island," 25 January 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 4 March 1945, while fighting was still taking place, the B-29 ''Dinah Might'' of the USAAF [[9th Bomb Group]] reported it was low on fuel near the island and requested an emergency landing. Despite enemy fire, the airplane landed on the [[South Field (Iwo Jima)|Allied-controlled section of the island (South Field)]], without incident, and was serviced, refueled and departed.

In all, 2,251 B-29 landings on Iwo Jima were recorded during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.506thfightergroup.org/iwotojapan.asp |title=Iwo To Japan|publisher=506th Fighter Group| accessdate=10 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100208225826/http://www.506thfightergroup.org/iwotojapan.asp| archivedate= 8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moskin records that 1,191 fighter escorts and 3,081 strike sorties were flown from Iwo Jima against Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The U.S. Marine Corps Story|url=https://archive.org/details/usmarinecorpssto0003mosk|url-access=registration|author= Moskin, J.Robert|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|page=[https://archive.org/details/usmarinecorpssto0003mosk/page/373 373]|year=1992|edition=3rd Revised|isbn=0-448-22688-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent Air Force study found the contribution of VII Fighter Command superfluous. Another rationale for capturing the island was to serve as a base for shorter-range [[B-24 Liberator]] bombers against Japan, but no significant B-24 bombing campaign ever materialized.&lt;ref name="navytimes19feb20"/&gt;

Some downed B-29 crewmen were saved by air-sea rescue aircraft and vessels operating from the island, but Iwo Jima was only one of many islands that could have been used for such a purpose. As for the importance of the island as a landing and refueling site for bombers, Marine Captain Robert Burrell, then a history instructor at the [[United States Naval Academy]], suggested that only a small proportion of the 2,251 landings were for genuine emergencies, the great majority possibly being for minor technical checkups, training, or refueling. According to Burrell,

{{quote|text=This justification became prominent only after the Marines seized the island and incurred high casualties. The tragic cost of Operation Detachment pressured veterans, journalists, and commanders to fixate on the most visible rationalization for the battle. The sight of the enormous, costly, and technologically sophisticated B-29 landing on the island's small airfield most clearly linked Iwo Jima to the strategic bombing campaign. As the myths about the flag raisings on Mount Suribachi reached legendary proportions, so did the emergency landing theory in order to justify the need to raise that flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert S.|last=Burrell|title=Breaking the Cycle of Iwo Jima Mythology: A Strategic Study of Operation Detachment|journal=[[The Journal of Military History]]|volume=68|issue=4|date=October 2004|pages=1143–1186| doi=10.1353/jmh.2004.0175|oclc=37032245}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "emergency landing" thesis counts every B-29 landing on Iwo Jima as an emergency and asserts that capturing the island saved the lives of the nearly 25,000 crewmen of all 2,251 planes (2,148 B-29 crewmen were killed in combat during the whole war in all theaters). However, of the nearly 2,000 B-29s which landed from May–July 1945, more than 80% were for routine refueling. Several hundred landings were made for training purposes, and most of the remainder were for relatively minor engine maintenance. During June 1945 which saw the largest number of landings, none of the more than 800 B-29s that landed on the island did so due to combat damage.
