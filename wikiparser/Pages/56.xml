The '''Battle of Cape Spada''' was a [[naval battle]] during the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]] in [[World War II|Second World War]]. It took place on 19 July 1940 in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] off [[Cape Spada]], the north-western extremity of [[Crete]].

==Prelude==
The battle occurred when an Allied squadron patrolling the Aegean encountered two Italian cruisers transferring from [[Tripoli]] to [[Leros]], at that time an Italian colony in the [[Dodecanese]] Islands. The Allied squadron was commanded by the [[Royal Australian Navy|Australian]] Captain [[John Augustine Collins|John Collins]] aboard the [[light cruiser]] {{HMAS|Sydney|1934|6}} and included the [[Royal Navy|British]] [[G and H-class destroyer|H-class destroyers]] {{HMS|Havock|H43|6}}, {{HMS|Hyperion|H97|2}}, {{HMS|Hasty|H24|2}}, {{HMS|Hero|H99|2}} and the similar {{sclass2-|I| destroyer|2}} {{HMS|Ilex|D61|2}}. The Italian 2nd Cruiser Division was commanded by Vice Admiral&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Ammiraglio di Divisione|Ammiraglio di Divisione]]. equivalent to Vice Admiral.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinando Casardi]] and consisted of the high-speed light cruisers {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Giovanni dalle Bande Nere||2}} and {{Ship|Italian cruiser|Bartolomeo Colleoni||2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark 2001, pp. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
When the Italians encountered the Allied destroyers at about 07:30, ''Sydney'' and ''Havock'' were {{convert|40|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} to the north on a sweep for submarines. The other destroyers led the Italian cruisers on a chase northwards to give ''Sydney'' time to come to the rescue. ''Sydney'' sighted the Italians at 08:26, opening fire at 08:29, and the Italian cruisers turned away to the southwest.

In the running battle which followed, ''Bartolomeo Colleoni'' was hard hit by ''Sydney'' and after a shell hit the boilers at 09:23 she stopped dead in the water. She fought on but was unable to manoeuvre or use the main battery; despite the fire from her {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} guns, she was sunk by three torpedoes launched from ''Ilex'' and ''Hyperion'' at 09:59. ''Sydney'' continued to fire against ''Bande Nere''. She was hit in the funnel by a single Italian shell, but managed to hit ''Bande Nere'' at least twice, killing eight in the bow and the hangar. Later, ''Sydney'' disengaged because she was short of ammunition and ''Giovanni delle Bande Nere'' returned to [[Benghazi]], shadowed by the battleship [[HMS Warspite (03)|HMS ''Warspite'']] and a screen of destroyers. 555 survivors of ''Bartolomeo Colleoni'' were rescued; 121 died.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara 2009, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The British destroyers were bombed by Italian aircraft in the aftermath, resulting in damage to HMS ''Havock'', whose nº 2 boiler was flooded. A floatplane from ''Warspite'', which was searching for ''Bande Nere'', ditched in the sea and was lost near [[Tobruk]]. The crew was captured by the Italians. Allied convoy AN.2 was ordered to sail back to [[Port Said]] and remain there until it was eventually known that ''Bande Nere'' had reached Benghazi.&lt;ref&gt;Titterton, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their speed advantage, the Italian cruisers failed to outrun HMAS ''Sydney'' because they had to steer south-southwest, instead of the most obvious route of escape to the south, in order to avoid being trapped between the enemy and the shores of Crete. This gave the Australian cruiser the chance to close the range, as she did. The light armour of ''Colleoni''  and  ''Bande Nere'' was unable to defeat ''Sydney''´s rounds. The lack of aerial reconnaissance was another factor contributing to the successful Allies' chase.&lt;ref&gt;Greene &amp; Massignani, pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;
