The '''Battle of Gemas'''—part of the wider [[Battle of Muar]]—took place during the Japanese [[Battle of Malaya|invasion of Malaya]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Campaign]] of the [[Second World War]]. The action occurred on 14 January 1942 at the [[Gemencheh]] Bridge near [[Gemas]] and saw around 1,000 troops of the [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 5th Division]] killed or wounded during a fierce ambush initiated by Australian soldiers from [[2/30th Battalion (Australia)|2/30th Battalion]], assigned to the [[27th Brigade (Australia)|27th Brigade]] of the [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Division]].

==Battle==
The 2/30th Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel [[Frederick Galleghan|Frederick "Black Jack" Galleghan]],&lt;ref name=Long140&gt;Long 1973, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; was ordered to mount an ambush on the main road, {{convert|11|km|mi}} west of Gemas in the hope of preventing the Japanese from advancing any further south.&lt;ref&gt;Wigmore 1957, pp. 211&amp;ndash;213.&lt;/ref&gt; The ambush site was located at a point where a wooden bridge crossed the Sungei Gemencheh river, connecting Gemas with the larger neighbouring town of [[Tampin]], and bringing traffic on the road into a long cutting through thick bushland.&lt;ref name=Coulthard197&gt;Coulthard-Clark 2001, p.197.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2/30th Battalion subsequently deployed one company in the ambush position {{convert|5|km|mi}} forward of the main body of the battalion.&lt;ref name=Long140/&gt;

The Japanese had passed through Tampin and needed to cross the bridge to reach Gemas and at 16:00 on 14 January 1942, "B" Company 2/30th Battalion under Captain Desmond Duffy, initiated the ambush. As the Japanese passed through the engagement area in their hundreds—many of them on bicycles—the bridge was blown and the Australians opened fire with machine guns, rifles and grenades. Faulty telephone lines back to the main battalion position prevented Duffy from being able to call in artillery fire on to the follow on Japanese forces, however, and the forward company was subsequently forced to withdraw after a 20-minute engagement as the Japanese began to press their positions.&lt;ref name=Coulthard197/&gt;

==Aftermath==
The battle following the ambush, and a further action closer to Gemas during which the Australian anti-tank gunners from the [[2/4th Anti-Tank Regiment (Australia)|2/4th Anti-Tank Regiment]] destroyed six out of eight Japanese tanks, lasted another two days.&lt;ref&gt;Long 1973, pp. 140–141.&lt;/ref&gt; The fighting ended with the Australians withdrawing through Gemas to the Fort Rose Estate. According to Coulthard-Clark, total Japanese casualties in the wider battle numbered over 1,000, while the Australians lost 81 killed, wounded or missing;&lt;ref name=Coulthard197/&gt; Allen Warren provides figures of 70 killed and 57 wounded in the initial engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Warren 2002, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the tactical victory at Gemas, as well as strong stands later at [[Battle of Muar#Siege of Bakri|Bakri]], the [[22nd Brigade (Australia)|22nd Australian Brigade’s]] ambush north of Jemaluang and the fighting withdrawal from Muar, the Japanese advance down the Malay Peninsula was only temporarily slowed.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis et al 2008, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary==
The Battle of Gemas has remained a footnote in the broader Battle of Muar until a documentary by the same name expanded the importance of this battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PFJe2rRXwM|title=Battle of Gemas|work=youtube.com|accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
