The '''Battle of Port Cros''' was a battle of [[World War II]] fought off the [[French Riviera]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] on the island of [[Port-Cros]]. The battle began when a [[United States Navy]] warship encountered two [[Nazi Germany|German]] warships in August 1944 while supporting the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Operation Dragoon]]. It was one of the few surface engagements fought between the US Navy and the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''. Later that day, the combined American and [[Canada|Canadian]] [[1st Special Service Force|Devil's Brigade]] was dropped on the main island and captured the German-held positions.

==Battle==
The American [[destroyer]] {{USS|Somers|DD-381|6}}—armed with six {{cvt|5|in|mm|sigfig=3}} [[Naval gun|gun]]s and eight {{cvt|21|in|mm|sigfig=3}} [[torpedo tube]]s&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Roger (2001) ''The Encyclopedia of Ships'', pg. 405. Amber Books, London. {{ISBN|9781905704439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2001) ''Jane's Fighting Ships of World War II'', pg. 284. Random House, London. {{ISBN|0517679639}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Both sources support Somers still having all three quad torpedo launchers. --&gt;—was cruising in the Mediterranean on 15 August 1944 when she came across the former [[Italy|Italian]] {{sclass-|Gabbiano|corvette}} ''Camoscio'' of {{cvt|738|LT|t|lk=on}}, which was renamed ''UJ6081'' by the ''Kriegsmarine''. Also involved was the former [[France|French]] [[aviso]] ''Amiral Senes'' of {{cvt|917|LT|t}}, renamed ''SG21''.&lt;ref&gt;Groner, p.237&lt;/ref&gt; ''UJ6081'' was armed with one {{cvt|3.9|in|mm}}gun and two {{cvt|17.7|in|mm}} torpedo tubes. The aviso was armed with two {{cvt|4.1|in|mm}} guns. It was early morning off Port Cros, about four hours before the Allied landing in [[Vichy France]], when the Americans sighted the German corvette. [[Commander]] [[Willam Christopher Hughes]] ordered a torpedo attack and directed his men to battle stations.

A spread of torpedoes was launched and the Germans opened fire as they attempted to maneuver out of harm's way. However, one torpedo slammed into the ''UJ6081''{{'}}s hull and she quickly began to sink. ''SG21'' was then spotted coming to the rescue. She was engaged by ''Somers''{{'}} main gun battery. The ensuing duel lasted for a few minutes until ''SG21'' was hit several times and began taking in water. Within a few more minutes, both German ships went down and ''Somers'' therefore left the area for naval gunfire support missions against targets along the French mainland. American forces suffered no damage or casualties.

Later that day, a mixed [[regiment]] of [[United States Army]] and [[Canadian Army]] [[infantry]], the 1st Special Service Force, was dropped onto Port Cros and captured the five [[fort]]s after a day-long battle with their German [[garrison]]s. The Allies assaulted two or three forts and seized the remaining without resistance. Nine paratroopers were killed in the land battle.{{clear left}}

==Aftermath==
As result of the battle, Commander Hughes was recognized for his victory and eventually rose to the rank of [[rear admiral]] partly due to his involvement in this action. After the engagement, the U.S. Army occupied [[Île du Levant|Le Levant]], another island nearby. Two days later, on 17 August, the former Italian corvette ''Antilope'', renamed ''UJ6082'', and the former [[Egypt]]ian armed [[yacht]] ''Nimet Allah'' were sunk by {{USS|Endicott|DD-495|6}} with help from two [[United Kingdom|British]] [[gunboat]]s at the [[Battle of La Ciotat]].
