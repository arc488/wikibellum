The '''Trasimene Line''' (so-named for [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimene]], the site of a major battle of the [[Second Punic War]] in 217 BC) was a [[Wehrmacht|German]] defensive line during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War II]]. It was sometimes known as the '''Albert Line'''. The German [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] (C-in-C), ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Albert Kesselring]], used the line to delay the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] northward advance in Italy in mid June 1944 to buy time to withdraw troops to the [[Gothic Line]] and finalise the preparation of its defenses.

==Background==
After the Allied capture of the Italian capital of [[Rome]] on 4 June 1944 following the successful [[Battle of Monte Cassino|breakthrough at Monte Cassino]] and [[Operation Shingle|Anzio]] during [[Operation Diadem]] in May 1944, the German [[14th Army (Wehrmacht)|14th]] and [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|10th Armies]] fell back: the 14th along the Tyrrhenian front and the 10th through central Italy and the Adriatic coast. There was a huge gap between the armies and with the Allies advancing some 10&amp;nbsp;km per day, the flanks of both armies were exposed and encirclement was threatened.&lt;ref name="Muhm"&gt;Muhm, ''German Tactics in the Italian Campaign''&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after Rome fell, [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander]], [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] (C-in-C) of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]] (AAI), received orders from his superior, General [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Sir Henry Maitland Wilson]], the [[Supreme Allied Commander|Allied Supreme Commander]] in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] (MTO), to push the retreating [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] {{convert|170|mi}} north to a line running from [[Pisa]] to [[Rimini]] (i.e. the [[Gothic Line]]) as quickly as possible to prevent the establishment of any sort of coherent enemy defense in central Italy.

==Battle==
On [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Mark W. Clark]]'s [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] front, the [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. VI Corps]], under [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Lucian Truscott]], was pushed up the coast along highway 1 and [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]], under Major General [[Geoffrey Keyes]], along highway 2 towards [[Viterbo]]. To their right the [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]], under [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] [[Sidney Kirkman]], part of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] under Lieutenant General [[Oliver Leese|Sir Oliver Leese]], headed up highway 3 towards [[Terni]] and [[Perugia]]&lt;ref&gt;Carver p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; whilst [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]], under Lieutenant General [[Charles Walter Allfrey]], advanced up the Adriatic coast.

Between 4 June and 16 June, whilst maintaining contact with the advancing Allies, Kesselring executed a remarkable and unorthodox maneuver with his depleted divisions, resulting in his two armies aligning and uniting their wings on the defensive positions on the Trasimene Line.&lt;ref name="Muhm"/&gt; Remarkable though this was, he was probably helped by the confusion caused in the Allied advance by the relieving of the U.S. II and VI Corps (substituted by Major General [[Willis D. Crittenberger]]'s [[IV Corps (United States)|U.S. IV Corps]] and [[Lieutenant general|Lieutenant General]] [[Alphonse Juin]]'s [[French Expeditionary Corps (1943&amp;ndash;44)|French Expeditionary Corps]]). The [[X Corps (United Kingdom)|British X Corps]], under Lieutenant General [[Richard McCreery]], had also been brought into the line on XIII Corps' right whilst V Corps had been relieved by the [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]], under Lieutenant General [[Władysław Anders]].

By the last week of June the Allies were facing the Trasimene positions. [[Joachim Lemelsen]]'s 14th Army had [[Frido von Senger und Etterlin]]'s [[XIV Panzer Corps]] facing the U.S. IV Corps on the west coast and [[Alfred Schlemm|Alfred von Schlemm]]'s [[I Parachute Corps (Germany)|1st Parachute Corps]] facing the French Expeditionary Corps beside them. On 22 June, a U.S. armored attack near [[Massa Marittima]] was defeated by a German tank platoon under ''Oberfähnrich'' Oskar Röhrig from Heavy Tank Battalion 503. The German [[Tiger I]]'s knocked out 11 [[Sherman tank]]s, while the terrified American tank crews abandoned another 12. The Germans suffered no losses. Röhrig was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] for this action.{{sfn|Schneider|2004|p=197}} Four Shermans were knocked out by two Tigers on 12 July near [[Collesalvetti]].{{sfn|Schneider|2004|p=198}}

[[Heinrich von Vietinghoff]]'s 10th Army had [[Traugott Herr]]'s [[LXXVI Panzer Corps]] facing XIII and X Corps and [[Valentin Feurstein]]'s [[German LI Mountain Corps|LI Mountain Corps]] facing the Polish II Corps on the Adriatic. The toughest defenses were around the lake itself with XIII Corps' [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 78th Infantry Division]] experiencing fierce fighting on 17 June at [[Città della Pieve]] and 21 June at [[San Fatucchio]]. By 24 June they had worked their way round to the north shore and linked with X Corps' [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th]] and [[10th Indian Infantry Division]]s as the German defenders withdrew towards [[Arezzo]].&lt;ref&gt;Carver, pp. 216-217&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July, the 2nd Company of the German [[508th Heavy Panzer Battalion]] knocked out four British Shermans near [[Tavarnelle Val di Pesa]] southwest of Florence.{{sfn|Schneider|2004|p=324}}

The U.S. IV Corps also found progress slow but by 1 July had crossed the river [[Cecina (river)|Cecina]] and were within {{convert|20|mi}} of [[Livorno]]. Meanwhile, the French Corps had been held up on the river [[Val d'Orcia|Orcia]] west of Lake Trasimene until the parachutist defenders withdrew on 27 June allowing them to enter [[Siena]] on 3 July.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;
