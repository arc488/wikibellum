'''Operation Jubilee''' or the '''Dieppe Raid''' (19 August 1942) was an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] amphibious attack on the German-occupied port of [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], northern France in the [[Second World War]]. Over 6,050 [[infantry]], predominantly Canadian, supported by a regiment of tanks, were put ashore from a naval force operating under protection of [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) fighters.

The port was to be captured and held for a short period, to test the feasibility of a landing and to gather intelligence. German coastal defences, port structures and important buildings were to be demolished. The raid had the added objectives of boosting morale and demonstrating the commitment of the [[United Kingdom]] to re-open the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western front]]. Aerial and naval support was insufficient to enable the ground forces to achieve their objectives; the tanks were trapped on the beach and the infantry was largely prevented from entering the town by obstacles and German fire. After less than six hours mounting casualties forced a retreat; only one landing force achieved its objective.

The operation was a fiasco in which the only success was in gathering [[military intelligence|intelligence]] including [[electronic intelligence]]. Of the 6,086 men who landed, within ten hours, 3,623 had been killed, wounded or became [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. The {{lang|de|[[Luftwaffe]]}} made a maximum effort against the landing as the RAF had expected but the RAF lost 106 aircraft (at least 32 to anti-aircraft fire or accidents), against 48 German losses. The Royal Navy lost 33 [[landing craft]] and a destroyer. The lessons of the Dieppe Raid influenced preparations for Allied seaborne operations such as the [[Normandy landings]] ([[Operation Overlord]]).

==Background==

===Dunkirk to Dieppe===
In the aftermath of the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] in May 1940, the British started on the development of a substantial raiding force under the umbrella of [[Combined Operations Headquarters]]. This was accompanied by the development of techniques and equipment for [[amphibious warfare]]. In late 1941, a scheme was put forward for the landing of 12 [[Division (military)|divisions]] around [[Le Havre]], assuming a withdrawal of German troops to counter Soviet success in the east. From this came Operation Rutter to test the feasibility of capturing a port by an opposed landing, the investigation of the problems of operating the invasion fleet and testing equipment and techniques of the assault.&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham 2004, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

After its victory in the [[Battle of Britain]] in 1940 and the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} having switched to night bombing in the fall of 1940, the day fighters of [[Royal Air Force]] [[RAF Fighter Command|Fighter Command]] were "a force without an immediate mission".&lt;ref name="Copp pages 6-9"&gt;Copp, Terry. "The Air over Dieppe." ''Legion'', June 1996, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Without anything else to do, the day fighters of RAF Fighter Command were in the spring of 1941 deployed on a series of search-and-destroy missions of flying over France to engage the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} in combat. In the second half of 1941, the aerial offensive over France was greatly stepped up, leading to the loss of 411 British and Canadian aircraft.&lt;ref name="Copp pages 6-9"/&gt; In the spring of 1942, the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} deployed the new [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] fighter to its airfields in France.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Copp, Terry. "The Air over Dieppe." ''Legion'', June 1996, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fw 190s were greatly superior to the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk V and [[Hawker Hurricane]] Mk IIs used by the British and Canadian pilots and losses over France increased.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The RAF was convinced it was winning the air war, believing that the loss of 259 Spitfires over France in the first six months of 1942 were justified by the reported destruction of 197 German aircraft in the same period (the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} actually lost 59 aircraft).{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} A major problem for the RAF was that the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} fighter pilots declined to engage in combat over the French coast and instead operated inland, forcing the Spitfires to fly deeper into France, using up their fuel, placing the British aircraft at a disadvantage when the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} engaged. Thanks to intelligence provided by [[Ultra]], the British knew that if any Allied force attempted to seize a port in France, the Germans would assume it to be the beginning of an invasion and that the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} was to mount a maximum effort. Fighter Command lobbied in early 1942, for a raid to seize a French port to provoke the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} into action with the RAF at an advantage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Dieppe===
Dieppe, a coastal town in the [[Seine-Inférieure]] [[Departments of France|department]] of France, is built along a long cliff that overlooks the [[English Channel]]. The [[River Scie]] is on the western end of the town and the [[River Arques]] flows through the town and into a medium-sized harbour. In 1942, the Germans had demolished some seafront buildings to aid in coastal defence and had set up two large artillery batteries at [[Berneval-le-Grand]] and [[Varengeville-sur-Mer]]. One important consideration for the planners was that Dieppe was within range of the Royal Air Force's fighter aircraft.&lt;ref name=juno&gt;[http://www.junobeach.org/canada-in-wwii/articles/the-dieppe-raid/ "Dieppe raid."] ''Juno Beach Centre''. Retrieved: 23 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also intense pressure from the Soviet government to open a second front in [[Western Europe]]. By early 1942, the Wehrmacht's [[Operation Barbarossa]] had clearly failed to destroy the Soviet Union. However, the Germans in a much less ambitious [[Case Blue|summer offensive]] launched in June, were deep into southern Soviet territory, pushing toward [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]. [[Joseph Stalin]] himself repeatedly demanded that the Allies create a second front in France to force the Germans to move at least 40 divisions away from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] to remove some of the pressure on the [[Red Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker 1992, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of the raid was discussed by [[Winston Churchill]] in his war memoirs:&lt;ref name="Churchill 1950, pp. 509-510"&gt;Churchill 1950, pp.&amp;nbsp;509–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I thought it most important that a large-scale operation should take place this summer, and military opinion seemed unanimous that until an operation on that scale was undertaken, no responsible general would take the responsibility of planning the main invasion&amp;nbsp;...In discussion with [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Admiral Mountbatten]] it became clear that time did not permit a new large-scale operation to be mounted during the summer ''(after Rutter had been cancelled)'', but that Dieppe could be remounted (with the new code-name "Jubilee") within a month, provided extraordinary steps were taken to ensure secrecy.  For this reason, no records were kept but, after the Canadian authorities and the Chiefs of Staff had given their approval, I personally went through the plans with the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|C.I.G.S.]], Admiral Mountbatten, and the Naval Force Commander, Captain J. Hughes-Hallett.}}

===Operation Rutter===
Operation Rutter was devised to satisfy several objectives, as a show of support for the [[Soviet Union]], to provide an opportunity for the Canadian forces in Britain to engage the German Army and as a morale booster for the British public, among whom were vociferous supporters of a second front to give tangible support to the Red Army. From a military point of view, when the real invasion of Europe began, it would be important quickly to capture a port before the Germans could demolish the facilities or re-capture it by counter-attack. The extent of the German fortification of French ports was uncertain and how organised an amphibious attack could be after a Channel crossing and how surprise could be achieved was also in doubt. Rutter could provide the experience that would be needed later in the war. Rutter was a combined operation, involving heavy bombers of [[RAF Bomber Command]] and the heavy ships of the Royal Navy to bombard German defences overlooking the beaches; parachute and glider troops would silence German heavy artillery commanding the approaches to the port. The main force of infantry and tanks would land and advance through the port to the outskirts and dig in to resist counter-attacks until it was time to withdraw and re-embark in their landing craft. The [[2nd Canadian Infantry Division]] was chosen to for the operation and given three months' specialist training in amphibious operations up to July. The Canadians assembled at embarkation ports and went aboard their ships, where the target was revealed. Inclement weather forced a delay in sailing and on 7 July, Rutter was cancelled and the troops disembarked.{{sfn|Christie|2000|pp=6–7}}&lt;ref name=bbcdieppe&gt;Thompson, Julian.

==Prelude==

===Operation Jubilee===

{{Further|Operation Jubilee order of battle}}

[[File:Cartenormandie2.PNG|thumb|{{centre|Dieppe in the {{lang|fr|département}} of [[Seine-Maritime]]}}]]
The Dieppe landings were planned on six beaches: four in front of the town itself, and two to the eastern and western flanks respectively.  From east to west, the beaches were codenamed Yellow, Blue, Red, White, Green and Orange. No.&amp;nbsp;3 Commando would land on Yellow beach, the [[Royal Regiment of Canada]] on Blue. The main landings would take place on Red and White beaches by [[the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry]], [[the Essex Scottish Regiment]], [[Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal]], [[A Commando Royal Marines]] and the armour. [[The South Saskatchewan Regiment]] and [[the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada]] would land on Green Beach,&lt;ref name=bbcdieppe/&gt; and No.&amp;nbsp;4 Commando on Orange.

Armoured support was provided by the [[The King's Own Calgary Regiment|14th Army Tank Regiment (The Calgary Regiment (Tank))]] with 58 of the newly introduced [[Churchill tank]]s in their first use in combat, to be delivered using the new [[landing craft tank]] (LCT).&lt;ref&gt;Henry 1993, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The Churchills, [[Deep wading|adapted to operate in the shallows]] near the beach, were a mix of types; some armed with a [[Ordnance QF 2-pounder|QF 2-pdr (40mm) gun]] in the turret and a [[Ordnance QF 3-inch howitzer|close support 3-inch howitzer]] in the hull, some had the [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|QF 6-pdr (47 mm)]], and three Churchills were equipped with [[Flame tank|flame-throwers]]. Engineers would use explosives to remove obstacles for the tanks.

===Naval support===
[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War- the Dieppe Raid, August 1942 A11228.jpg|thumb|right| [[LCM 1|Landing Craft Mechanised Mark 1]] on exercise before Dieppe]]
The [[Royal Navy]] supplied 237 ships and landing craft. However, pre-landing naval gunfire support was limited, consisting of six [[Hunt-class destroyer]]s each with four or six 4-inch (102 mm) guns. This was because of the reluctance of [[First Sea Lord]] [[Sir Dudley Pound]] to risk [[capital ship]]s in an area he believed vulnerable to attacks by German aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Atkin 1980, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Mountbatten asked Pound to send a battleship in to provide fire support for the Dieppe raid but Pound was mindful that Japanese aircraft had sunk the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Repulse|1916|6}} and the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|2}} off Malaya in December 1941 and he would not risk capital ships into waters where the Allies did not have air supremacy.&lt;ref name=Copp200434&gt;Copp 2004, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air plan===

====Fighter Command====

{{further|RAF Fighter Command#1942–45|l1=Fighter Command 1942–45|Circus offensive}}

Over the past eighteen months of inconclusive [[Attrition warfare|attritional]] engagements, Fighter Command has established a measure of air superiority within range of its fighters. Day incursions into British airspace had dwindled to the occasional pair of German fighter bombers racing across the Channel, dropping their bombs and racing back. At 06:15 on 7 July, two ships in the [[The Solent|Solent]], with troops for Rutter on board, were hit but the bombs failed to explode and passed through their hulls, causing only four minor casualties. German photographic reconnaissance was much more difficult, because adequate results required the aircraft to fly a set course and height. Repeat sorties once or twice a week were ideal for comparative analysis of photographs but the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} could manage only one set of pictures a month. A partial reconnaissance was obtained from 28 to 31 July, after Rutter had been cancelled and not again until 24 August, five days after Jubilee.{{sfn|Greenhous|1994|pp=232–233}} The air plan was to exploit the raid to force the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} to fight on British terms and suffer a serious defeat; Air Vice-Marshal [[Trafford Leigh-Mallory]], the commander of [[No. 11 Group RAF|11 Group]] Fighter Command was  to command the air effort, for which 56 fighter squadrons, comprising Spitfire fighters, Hurricane fighter-bombers and Typhoon low-level interceptors.{{efn|The Hurricanes were a mix of "Cannon-armed" Hurricane IIC and bomb carrying Hurricanes &lt;!-- C for cannon but IIB is 12 mg version --&gt; }} Four [[North American P-51 Mustang|Mustang Mk I]] squadrons of [[RAF Army Cooperation Command|Army Cooperation Command]] were provided for long-range reconnaissance and a contingent of five bomber squadrons were to participate for smoke laying and tactical bombing. The landings could be expected to prompt a maximum effort by the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} in Northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands, with about 250 fighters and 220 bombers.{{sfn|Richards|Saunders|1975|pp=143–144}}

Leigh-Mallory controlled the air battle from 11 Group headquarters at [[RAF Uxbridge]]; commands flowing [[Dowding system|through the system as normal]] to Sector control rooms and from there to the airfields.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh-Mallory p61&lt;/ref&gt; An RAF officer from Hut 3 at Bletchley Park was seconded to the 11 Group Operations Room to filter material to the [[Y-stations]] at [[Woodhead Hall|RAF Cheadle]] and [[RAF Kingsdown]] which intercepted [[Wireless telegraphy]] (W/T) and [[Radiotelephone|Radio telephony]] (R/T) transmissions and used [[direction finding]] to pinpoint the origin of the signals. The intention was to reduce the time to pass decryptions of material from German radar, observer posts and fighter control to 11 Group through "the most expert officer in Y on German Fighter Defence and its ramifications".{{sfn|Macksey|2004|p=151}} The Fighter Controllers on the [[Headquarters ship]] {{HMS|Calpe|L71|6}} and {{HMS|Berkeley|L17|2}} could communicate with the raid fighter cover on a shared frequency. The "Close Support" fighters checked in with the headquarters ship as they approached so the Fighter Controller could direct them onto alternative targets as required.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh-Mallory p61&lt;/ref&gt;

The moving of squadrons within 11 Group and reinforcement with 15 squadrons from outside 11 Group were carried out 14-15 August under the guise of "Exercise Venom".&lt;ref&gt;Leigh-Mallory "After Action Report", para 7, 69&lt;/ref&gt;

====2 Group====

{{further|No. 2 Group RAF}}
On 29 June, [[No. 2 Group RAF|2 Group]], Bomber Command, was ordered to send sixteen [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Douglas Bostons]] each from [[No. 88 Squadron RAF|88 Squadron]] and [[No. 107 Squadron RAF|107 Squadron]] from their [[East Anglia]]n bases to [[RAF Ford]] in West Sussex; [[No. 226 Squadron RAF|226 Squadron]], with its long range Bostons, was to stand by at its base for Operation Rutter. From 4 July, aircraft were to be maintained at thirty minutes readiness to fly [[Glossary of RAF code names|Circus]] operations against German road transport and any tanks that appeared. For speed the crews were briefed in advance and were to have a final briefing at their airfield dispersals just before take-off. The operation was cancelled after two assault ships were bombed by the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}}. On 14 August, 2 Group was notified that the raid on Dieppe was back on as Operation Jubilee. The move to RAF Ford was retained but 226 Squadron was to fly from [[RAF Thruxton]] in Hampshire to lay smoke screens to obstruct German gunners on the high ground around Dieppe. No. 226 Squadron, joined by four crews from the other squadrons, began training at Thruxton on smoke munitions, {{cvt|100|lb|kg}} smoke bombs and [[Smoke Curtain Installations]], carried in the bomb bays of some of the Bostons, which were to take off before dawn and operate without fighter escort.{{sfn|Bowyer|1979|pp=248–249}}

===Intelligence===
Intelligence on the area was sparse: there were dug-in German gun positions on the cliffs, but these had not been detected or spotted by air reconnaissance photographers. The planners had assessed the beach gradient and its suitability for tanks only by scanning holiday snapshots, which led to an underestimation of the German strength and of the terrain.&lt;ref name=bbcdieppe/&gt;  The outline plan for the abortive Operation Rutter (which became the basis for Operation Jubilee) stated that "intelligence reports indicate that Dieppe is not heavily defended and that the beaches in the vicinity are suitable for landing infantry, and armoured fighting vehicles at some".&lt;ref&gt;Atkin 1980, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===German forces===

====Army====
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-291-1213-34, Dieppe, Landungsversuch, deutsche MG-Stellung.jpg|thumb|left|A German [[MG34]] medium machine gun emplacement]]
The German forces at Dieppe were on high alert, having been warned by French [[double agent]]s that the British were showing interest in the area. They had also detected increased radio traffic and landing craft being concentrated in the southern British coastal ports.&lt;ref name=bbcdieppe/&gt; Dieppe and the flanking cliffs were well defended; the 1,500-strong garrison from the [[302nd Static Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|302nd Static Infantry Division]] comprised the 570th, 571st and 572nd Infantry Regiments, each of two battalions, the 302nd Artillery Regiment, the 302nd Reconnaissance Battalion, the 302nd Anti-tank Battalion, the 302nd Engineer Battalion and 302nd Signal Battalion. They were deployed along the beaches of Dieppe and the neighbouring towns, covering all the likely landing places. The city and port were protected by heavy artillery on the main approach (particularly in the myriad cliff caves) and with a [[Military reserve|reserve]] at the rear. The defenders were stationed in the towns and in intervening open areas and highlands that overlooked the beaches.  Elements of the 571st Infantry Regiment defended the Dieppe [[Radar|radar station]] near Pourville and the artillery battery over the [[Scie (river)|Scie river]] at Varengeville. To the east, the 570th Infantry Regiment was deployed near the artillery battery at Berneval-le-Grand.

===={{lang|de|Luftwaffe}}====

The {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} fighter force comprised ''[[Jagdgeschwader 2]]'' (JG2) and ''[[Jagdgeschwader 26]]'' (JG26), with about 120 serviceable fighters, mostly Fw 190s to oppose the landings and escort around 100 serviceable bombers of ''[[Kampfgeschwader 2]]'' and the specialist anti-shipping bombers of III./''[[Kampfgeschwader 53]]'' (KG 53), II./''[[Kampfgeschwader 40]]'' (KG 40) and I./[[Kampfgeschwader 77]] (KG 77) mostly equipped with [[Dornier Do 217|Dornier 217s]].{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

==Battle==

On the night of 18/19 August, RAF Coastal Command carried out anti-surface vessel (ASV) patrols of the coast from Boulogne to Cherbourg; after sunrise the patrols were carried out by fighters. The Allied fleet left the south coast of [[England]] during the night, preceded by [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]] from [[Port of Newhaven|Newhaven]] clearing paths through the English Channel, followed by the flotilla of eight destroyers and accompanying [[Motor Gun Boat]]s escorting the landing craft and [[Motor Launch]]es.
. 
===Initial landings===
[[File:Dieppe Raid landing beaches.jpg|thumb|left|Colour-coded Dieppe Raid beaches]]

The initial landings began at 04:50 on 19 August, with attacks on the artillery batteries on the flanks of the main landing area. These were [[Varengeville]] – [[Sainte-Marguerite-sur-Mer]] (known as Orange Beach) by No. 4 Commando, [[Pourville]] (Green Beach) by the South Saskatchewan Regiment and the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada, Puys (Blue Beach) by the Royal Regiment of Canada, and Berneval (Yellow Beach) by No. 3 Commando. On their way in, the landing craft and escorts heading towards Puys and Berneval ran into and exchanged fire with a small German convoy at 03:48.&lt;ref name=bbcdieppe/&gt; The Allied destroyers {{HMS|Brocklesby|L42|6}} and [[ORP Ślązak (L26)|ORP ''Ślązak'']] noticed the engagement, but their commanders incorrectly assumed that the landing craft had come under fire from the shore batteries and did not come to their rescue.&lt;ref name="Ford-41"&gt;Ford 2004, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:No. 3 Commando men after Dieppe raid.jpg|thumb|alt=nine British soldiers and one sailor on a small boat at sea. A Union Jack flies from a mast at the rear. | Unlike [[No. 4 Commando]], [[No. 3 Commando|No. 3]] wore steel helmets during the raid]]
The mission for [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[John Durnford-Slater]] and No.&amp;nbsp;3 Commando was to conduct two landings {{cvt|8|mi}} east of Dieppe to silence the coastal battery ''Goebbels'' near Berneval. The battery could fire upon the landing at Dieppe {{cvt|4|mi}} to the west. The three {{cvt|170|mm}} and four {{cvt|105|mm}} guns of ''2/770 Batterie'' had to be out of action by the time the main force approached the main beach.

The craft carrying No.&amp;nbsp;3 Commando, approaching the coast to the east, were not warned of the approach of a German coastal [[convoy]] that had been located by British "[[Chain Home]]" radar stations at 21:30. German [[E-boat|S-boats]] escorting a German tanker [[torpedo]]ed some of the LCP landing craft and disabled the escorting [[Steam Gun Boat]] 5. Subsequently, ML 346 and [[Landing Craft#Landing Craft Flak|Landing Craft Flak]] 1 combined to drive off the German boats but the group was dispersed, with some losses, and the enemy's coastal defences were alerted. The commandos from six craft who did land on Yellow I were beaten back and, unable to safely retreat or join the main force, had to surrender. Only 18 commandos got ashore on Yellow II beach. They reached the perimeter of the battery via Berneval, after it was attacked by Hurricane fighter-bombers, engaging their target with small arms fire. Although unable to destroy the guns, their sniping for a time managed to distract the battery to such good effect that the gunners fired wildly and there was no known instance of this battery sinking any of the assault convoy ships off Dieppe. The commandos were eventually forced to withdraw in the face of superior enemy forces.&lt;ref name=bbcdieppe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warfaremagazine.co.uk/articles/dieppe-operation-jubilee/61 Dieppe – Operation Jubilee] Warfare Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission for Lieutenant Colonel [[Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat|Lord Lovat]] and No.&amp;nbsp;4 Commando (including 50 [[United States Army Rangers]]) was to conduct two landings {{cvt|6|mi|km}} west of Dieppe to neutralize the coastal battery {{lang|de|Hess}} at Blancmesnil-Sainte-Marguerite near Varengeville. Landing on the right flank in force at 04:50, they climbed the steep slope and attacked and neutralized their target, the artillery battery of six 150&amp;nbsp;mm guns. This was the only success of Operation Jubilee.&lt;ref name=bbcdieppe/&gt;  The commando then withdrew at 07:30 as planned.&lt;ref name=juno/&gt; Most of No.&amp;nbsp;4 safely returned to England.

===Blue beach===

The naval engagement between the small German convoy and the craft carrying No.&amp;nbsp;3 Commando had alerted the German defenders at Blue beach. The landing near Puys by the Royal Regiment of Canada plus three platoons from the [[The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada|Black Watch of Canada]] and an artillery detachment were tasked to neutralize machine gun and artillery batteries protecting this Dieppe beach.
They were delayed by 20 minutes and the smoke screens that should have hidden their assault had already lifted. The advantages of surprise and darkness were thus lost, while the Germans had manned their defensive positions in preparation for the landings. The well-fortified German forces held the Canadian forces that did land on the beach. As soon as they reached the shore, the Canadians found themselves pinned against the seawall, unable to advance. With a bunker placed to sweep along the back of the seawall, the Royal Regiment of Canada was annihilated. Of the 556 men in the regiment, 200 were killed and 264 captured.&lt;ref name=juno/&gt;

===Green Beach===

[[File:Green Beach Landing Zones, Dieppe Raid.jpg|thumb|left|Green Beach]]
On Green beach at the same time that No.&amp;nbsp;4 Commando had landed at Orange Beach, the [[South Saskatchewan Regiment]]'s 1st Battalion was headed towards Pourville. They beached at 04:52, without having been detected. The battalion managed to leave their landing craft before the Germans could open fire. However, on the way in, some of the landing craft had drifted off course and most of the battalion found themselves west of the River Scie rather than east of it. Because they had been landed in the wrong place, the battalion, whose objective was the hills east of the village and the Hindenburg Battery artillery, had to enter Pourville to cross the river by the only bridge.&lt;ref name=juno/&gt; Before the Saskatchewans managed to reach the bridge, the Germans had positioned machine guns and anti-tank guns there which stopped their advance. With the battalion's dead and wounded piling up on the bridge, Lieutenant Colonel [[Charles Cecil Ingersoll Merritt]], the commanding officer, attempted to give the attack impetus by repeatedly and openly crossing the bridge, in order to demonstrate that it was feasible to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Atkin 1980, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the assault resuming, the South Saskatchewans and the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada, who had landed beside them, were unable to reach their target.&lt;ref name=juno/&gt; While the Camerons did manage to penetrate further inland than any other troops that day, they were also soon forced back as German reinforcements rushed to the scene.&lt;ref name=bbcdieppe/&gt; Both battalions suffered more losses as they withdrew; only 341 men were able to reach the landing craft and embark, and the rest were left to surrender. For his part in the battle, Lieutenant Colonel Merritt was awarded the Victoria Cross.&lt;ref name=GazetteVCs /&gt;

One of the objectives of the Dieppe Raid was to discover the importance and performance of a German radar station on the cliff-top to the east of the town of Pourville. To achieve this, RAF [[Flight Sergeant]] [[Jack Nissenthall]], a radar specialist, was attached to the South Saskatchewan Regiment landing at Green Beach. He was to attempt to enter the radar station and learn its secrets, accompanied by a small unit of 11 men of the Saskatchewans as bodyguards. Nissenthall volunteered for the mission fully aware that, due to the highly sensitive nature of his knowledge of Allied radar technology, his Saskatchewan bodyguard unit was under orders to kill him to prevent him from being captured. He also carried a [[suicide pill|cyanide pill]] as a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;Atkin 1980, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Lord Mountbatten claimed to author [[James Leasor]], when being interviewed during research for the book ''Green Beach'', that "If I had been aware of the orders given to the escort to shoot him rather than let him be captured, I would have cancelled them immediately". Nissenthall and his bodyguards failed to overcome the radar station defences but Nissenthall was able to crawl up to the rear of the station under enemy fire and cut all telephone wires leading to it. The operators inside resorted to radio to talk to their commanders which was intercepted by listening posts on the south coast of England. The Allies were able to learn a great deal about the location and density of German radar stations along the Channel coast which helped to convince Allied commanders of the importance of developing radar jamming technology. Only Nissenthall and one South Saskatchewan of the party returned to England.&lt;ref&gt;Leasor, James.

===Main Canadian landings===
====Red and White Beaches====

Preparing the ground for the main landings, four destroyers were bombarding the coast as landing craft approached. At 05:15, they were joined by five RAF Hurricane squadrons who bombed the coastal defences and set a smokescreen to protect the assault troops. Between 03:30, and 03:40, 30 minutes after the initial landings, the main frontal assault by the Essex Scottish and the [[Royal Hamilton Light Infantry]] started. Their infantry was meant to be supported by Churchill tanks of the 14th Army Tank Regiment landing at the same time, but the tanks arrived on the beach late. As a result, the two infantry battalions had to attack without armour support. They were met with heavy machine-gun fire from [[Machine gun nest|emplacements]] dug into the overlooking cliffs. Unable to clear the obstacles and scale the seawall, they suffered heavy losses.&lt;ref name=bbcdieppe/&gt; Captain [[Denis Whitaker]] of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry recalled a scene of absolute carnage and confusion, with soldiers being cut down by German fire all along the sea wall while his commanding officer, Colonel Bob Labatt, desperately tried to use a broken radio to contact General Roberts while ignoring his men.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Arthur.

Retrieved: 5 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; When the tanks eventually arrived only 29 were landed. Two of those sank in deep water, and 12 more became bogged down in the soft [[shingle beach]]. Only 15 of the tanks made it up to and across the seawall. Once they crossed the seawall, they were confronted by a series of tank obstacles that prevented their entry into the town. Blocked from going further, they were forced to return to the beach where they provided fire support for the now retreating infantry. None of the tanks managed to return to England. All the crews that landed were either killed or captured.&lt;ref name=juno/&gt;

Unaware of the situation on the beaches because of a smoke screen laid by the supporting destroyers, Major General Roberts sent in the two reserve units: the [[Fusiliers Mont-Royal]] and the [[Royal Marines]]. At 07:00, the Fusiliers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel [[Dollard Ménard]] in 26 landing craft sailed towards their beach. They were heavily engaged by the Germans, who hit them with heavy machine gun, mortar and grenade fire, and destroyed them; only a few men managed to reach the town.&lt;ref name=juno/&gt; Those men were then sent in towards the centre of Dieppe and became pinned down under the cliffs and Roberts ordered the Royal Marines to land in order to support them. Not being prepared to support the Fusiliers, the Royal Marines had to transfer from their gunboats and motorboat transports onto landing craft. The Royal Marine landing craft were heavily engaged on their way in with many destroyed or disabled. Those Royal Marines that did reach the shore were either killed or captured. As he became aware of the situation the Royal Marine commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Phillipps, stood upon the stern of his landing craft and signalled for the rest of his men to turn back. He was killed a few moments later.&lt;ref name=bbcdieppe/&gt;

During the raid, a mortar platoon from the [[Calgary Highlanders]], commanded by Lieutenant F. J.

===Air operations===

At 04:16 six Bostons attacked German coastal artillery in the twilight which led to the results not being observed. Soon afterwards 14 Bostons flew to Dieppe to drop smoke bombs around the German guns on the eastern heights, bombing the {{lang|de|Bismarck}} batteries between 05:09 and 05:44 with a hundred and fifty {{cvt|100|lb|kg}} smoke bombs at {{cvt|50|–|70|ft|m}}, flying through a storm of anti-aircraft fire.

==Aftermath==

===Analyses===

====German====
[[File:Dieppe Raid c029878.jpg|thumb|German soldiers examine a [[Churchill tank]] at Dieppe]]
The capture of a copy of the Dieppe plan allowed the Germans to analyse the operation. Senior German officers were unimpressed; General [[Konrad Haase]] considered it "incomprehensible" that a division was expected to overrun a German regiment that was supported by artillery. "...the strength of naval and air forces was entirely insufficient to suppress the defenders during the landings". General [[Adolf-Friedrich Kuntzen]] believed it "inconceivable" that the Pourville landings were not reinforced with tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Atkin 1980, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans were unimpressed by the Churchill tanks left behind; one report concluded "in its present form the Churchill is easy to fight". Its gun was described as "poor and obsolete" and the armour was compared unfavourably with that used in German and Soviet tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Atkin 1980, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans recognized that the Allies were certain to learn some lessons from the operation, with General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] observing that, "Just as we are going to evaluate these experiences for the future so is the assaulting force&amp;nbsp;... perhaps even more so as it has gained the experience dearly. He will not do it like this a second time!".&lt;ref&gt;Atkin 1980, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allied====
Dieppe became a textbook example of "what not to do" in amphibious operations and laid the framework for the [[Normandy landings]] two years later. Dieppe showed the need for 
# preliminary artillery support, including aerial bombardment&lt;ref name=bbcdieppe/&gt;
# surprise
# proper intelligence concerning enemy fortifications
# avoidance of a frontal attack on a defended port
# proper re-embarkation craft.&lt;ref name=green1/&gt;

While the Canadian contingent fought bravely in the face of a determined enemy, it was ultimately circumstances outside their control which sealed their fate.&lt;ref name=green1&gt;Maguire 1963, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite criticism concerning the inexperience of the Canadian brigades, scholars have noted that even seasoned professionals would have been hard-pressed under the deplorable conditions brought about by their superiors. The commanders who planned the raid on Dieppe had not envisaged such losses.&lt;ref name=green1/&gt; This was one of the first attempts by the Western Allies on a German-held port city. As a consequence, planning from the highest ranks in preparation for the raid was minimal. Basic strategic and tactical errors were made which resulted in scores of Allied (particularly Canadian) deaths.

The British developed [[Hobart's Funnies|specialist armoured vehicles]] for engineers to perform tasks protected by armour. 

While the RAF were able to keep German aircraft from the land battle and the ships, the operation showed "major deficiencies in RAF ground support techniques" and this led to the creation of an integrated [[tactical air force]] for army support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/rafhistorytimeline1942.cfm "RAF History Timeline 1942."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206093456/http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/rafhistorytimeline1942.cfm |date=2010-12-06 }} ''raf.mod.uk,'' 2012 [last update].

Retrieved: 29 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies changed their view that capturing a big port was necessary to establish a second front. The damage inflicted on a port to capture it, would make it useless afterwards.

The Germans suffered suffered 591 casualties, 322 fatal and 280 wounded, 48 aircraft and one patrol boat.{{sfn|Rahn|2001|p=441}} Of the 50 US Army Rangers serving in Commando units, six were killed, seven wounded and four captured.

The losses at Dieppe were claimed to be a necessary evil.&lt;ref name=green1/&gt; Mountbatten later justified the raid by arguing that lessons learned at Dieppe in 1942 were put to good use later in the war. He later claimed, "I have no doubt that the Battle of Normandy was won on the beaches of Dieppe. For every man who died in Dieppe, at least 10 more must have been spared in Normandy in 1944." In direct response to the raid on Dieppe, Churchill remarked that "My Impression of 'Jubilee' is that the results fully justified the heavy cost" and that it "was a Canadian contribution of the greatest significance to final victory."&lt;ref&gt;Maguire 1963, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

To others, especially Canadians, it was a major disaster. The exception was the success gained by the battle-hardened British commandos against the coast artillery batteries near Varengeville and Berneval. Of the nearly 5,000 Canadian soldiers, more than 900 were killed (about 18 per cent) and 1,874 taken prisoner (37%).&lt;ref name="Herd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grimsley, Mark.

Pétain suggested that French troops be allowed to serve with German coastal garrisons, a suggestion that was not viewed with enthusiasm by the German Army and nothing came of it. The letter was given much publicity in Germany and France as a sign of how the French people allegedly appreciated Germany's efforts to defend them from ''les Anglo-Saxons''. Pétain's letter was later used as an exhibit for the prosecution at his trial for high treason in 1945.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=338}}

Though the Allies continued to lose on average two aircraft for every one German aircraft destroyed for the rest of 1942, the output of fighters by the United States, Britain and Canada combined with better Allied pilot training led to the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} gradually losing the war of attrition in the skies above France.

The plan, later criticized{{by whom|date=June 2020}} for its size and needless complexity, contained orders to shackle prisoners.&lt;ref name="Shackling"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bowmanville, 1942: The 'Shackling Crisis' and the Treatment of German Prisoners of War in Canada |url=http://hhr-atlas.ieg-mainz.de/articles/turcotte-bowmanville |website=Online Atlas on the History of Humanitarianism and Human Rights |publisher=IEG |accessdate=7 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Special Service Brigade tied the hands of prisoners taken on raids and the practice had been ordered for the Dieppe Raid "to prevent destruction of their documents". Roberts objected to this with the chief of combined operations. After capturing the orders for Operation Jubilee, the Germans threatened on 2 September to shackle the prisoners taken at Dieppe. The War Office announced that if an order existed it would be rescinded and the Germans withdrew the threat on 3 September. On 7 October the Germans revived the controversy after more information emerged about the Dieppe operation and that German prisoners taken during  [[Operation Basalt|the small 4 Octobera raid]] on [[Sark]] on  were alleged to have been tied. On 8 October British and Canadian prisoners were tied in reprisal, which led to counter reprisals.{{sfn|Stacey|1956|pp=396–297}} Supposed Anglo-Canadian atrocities committed against German POWs at Dieppe was one of the excuses Hitler gave for the [[Commando Order]] of October 1942 for all Allied commando prisoners to be executed. Hitler decided to reward the town for not helping in the raid by freeing French POWs from Dieppe and Berlin radio announced the release of {{nowrap|750 "sons}} of Dieppe" imprisoned since 1940.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=338}} For the town residents' "perfect discipline and calm", although the residents had not had much time to furnish the invaders with an instant [[Fifth column|Fifth Column]], Hitler gave the town a gift of [[French franc|Fr]] 10 million, to repair the damage caused during the raid.&lt;ref&gt;Atkin 1980, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

===German preparedness===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-291-1230-05, Dieppe, Landungsversuch, tote alliierte Soldaten.jpg|thumb|Canadian and British dead at Dieppe, August 1942]]
The fiasco has led to a discussion of whether the Germans knew of the raid in advance. Security in the area from which the operation was launched was poor and 'a good deal could be deduced simply by shrewd observation and careful attention to careless talk'.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1993, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since June 1942, the [[BBC]] had been broadcasting warnings to French civilians of a "likely" action, urging them to quickly evacuate the Atlantic coastal districts.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT warning"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1942/06/09/archives/warning-by-radio-notice-of-likely-war-moves-given-civilians-in.html "Warning by radio: Notice of 'likely' war moves given civilians in Nazi-held zone."] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 June 1942, p. 1. Retrieved: 20 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pittsburg"&gt;Beattie, Edward W. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wFcbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hkwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4918,6321900 "Big Commando Attack Due, England Hints."] ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' 8 June 1942. Retrieved: 9 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, on the day of the raid itself, the BBC announced it, albeit at 08:00, after the landings had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1993, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

First-hand accounts and memoirs of many Canadian veterans who documented their experiences on the shores of Dieppe remark about the preparedness of the German defences as if they were warned, on touching down on the Dieppe shore, the landing ships were immediately shelled with the utmost precision as troops disembarked. The volume and tone of these accounts meant that a Canadian government report at the end of 1942, concluded that "They seem to have had ample warning of the raid and to have made thorough preparations for dealing with it".&lt;ref&gt;Atkin 1980, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Commanding officer Lt Colonel Labatt testified to having seen markers on the beach used for mortar practice, which appeared to have been recently placed.&lt;ref&gt;Stacey 1944, paragraph 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief that the Germans were forewarned has been strengthened by accounts of German and Allied POWs. Major C. E. Page, while interrogating a German soldier, found out that four machine-gun battalions were brought in "specifically" in anticipation of a raid. There are numerous accounts of interrogated German prisoners, German captors and French citizens who all conveyed to Canadians that the Germans had been preparing for the landing for weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Poolton and Poolton-Turney 1998, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker 1992, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is likely that the Germans were expecting an attack somewhere on the French shoreline, evidence of expectation of an attack at Dieppe is less conclusive.  Proponents of this view point out that elements of the Canadian forces, such as at Green beach, landed without trouble. Merrit said "How could the Germans have known if we got in on our beach against defences which were unmanned?".&lt;ref&gt;Atkin 1980, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;  No 4 Commando also reported that they achieved surprise against the gun batteries they were to destroy.&lt;ref&gt;Atkin 1980, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Statements by German POWs that the raid was fully expected are explained as being propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 1993, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Daily Telegraph'' crossword controversy====
On 17 August 1942, the clue "French port (6)" appeared in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' crossword (compiled by [[Leonard Dawe]]), followed by the solution, "[[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]]"; the raid on Dieppe took place the next day, on 19 August.&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;Fleming, Vic. [http://www.dailyrecord.us/Story.aspx?id=416&amp;date=9%2F5%2F2008 "Mystery of the D-day crosswords, Part 1."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119084839/http://www.dailyrecord.us/Story.aspx?id=416&amp;date=9%2F5%2F2008 |date=January 19, 2012}} ''Daily Record'' (Little Rock), 2008. Retrieved: 7 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The War Office suspected that the crossword had been used to pass intelligence to the Germans and called upon [[John Buchan, 2nd Baron Tweedsmuir|Lord Tweedsmuir]], a senior intelligence officer attached to the Canadian Army, to investigate. Tweedsmuir later said, "We noticed that the crossword contained the word 'Dieppe', and there was an immediate and exhaustive inquiry which also involved [[MI5]]. But in the end, it was concluded that it was just a remarkable coincidence—a complete fluke".&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert 2008, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[D-Day Daily Telegraph crossword security alarm|A similar crossword coincidence occurred in May 1944]], prior to D-Day. Multiple terms associated with [[Operation Overlord]] (including the word "Overlord") appeared in the ''Daily Telegraph'' crossword (also written by Dawe) and after another investigation by MI5 which concluded that it was another coincidence. Further to this, a former student identified that Dawe frequently requested words from his students, many of whom were children in the same area as US military personnel.&lt;ref name="crossword panic"&gt;Wallington, Richard S.

===The Enigma pinch===
Research undertaken over a 15-year period by military historian [[David O'Keefe (historian)|David O'Keefe]] uncovered 100,000 pages of classified British military archival files that documented a "[[theft|pinch]]" mission overseen by [[Ian Fleming]] (best known later as author of the [[James Bond]] novels), coinciding with the Dieppe Raid. O'Keefe states that [[No. 30 Commando]] was sent to Dieppe to steal one of the new German 4-rotor [[Enigma code machine]]s, plus associated codebooks and rotor setting sheets. The [[Naval Intelligence Division]] (NID) planned the "pinch" to pass such items to [[cryptanalysts]] at [[Bletchley Park]] to assist with Ultra decryption operations.&lt;ref name = OKeefe&gt;Ogrodnik, Irene. [http://www.globalnews.ca/feature/6442694158/story.html "Breaking German codes real reason for 1942 Dieppe raid: historian."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024084451/http://www.globalnews.ca/feature/6442694158/story.html |date=October 24, 2012}} ''Global News,'' 9 August 2012. Retrieved: 13 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Keefe alleges the presence of other troops landing at Dieppe was to provide support and create a distraction for the commando units attempting to reach the German admiralty headquarters and capture the Enigma machine, that the premise of the Dieppe Raid was 'cover' for the Enigma target.

No 30 Commando was not formed until a month after the raid and indications of involvement may be erroneous.&lt;ref name=kingscollege&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=2 June 2010|publisher=Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives, [[King's College London]]|title=History of 30 Assault Unit 1942–1946|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/summary/xh40-001.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An article that ran in ''Britain at War Magazine'' in August 2017 provided an alternative view. In that issue, Professor of Naval History, [[Eric Grove]], explained that the 'Enigma Pinch' is "more a reflection of the contemporary fascination with secret intelligence rather than the reality of 1942."&lt;ref name = BWM/&gt; Obtaining useful intelligence was among the objectives - including the capture of a four-rotor Enigma cipher machine but it was one of many objectives. Grove concludes that the Dieppe Raid was not, as claimed, cover for a ‘snatch’ and also recognizes that the decision to form the Intelligence Assault Units to gather intelligence material was not made until after Operation Jubilee had been ordered.&lt;ref name = BWM&gt;Britain at War Magazine, August 2017, Section 'The Dieppe Raid, 75th Anniversary (Article: Dieppe - The Reason Why; Box Panel, The Enigma Factor) p.66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dieppe War Cemetery===
[[Image:Dieppe Canadian War Cemetery.jpg|thumb|The current grave markers in the Dieppe Canadian War Cemetery]]
Allied dead were initially buried in a mass grave but the bodies were reburied at Vertus Wood on the edge of the town.&lt;ref&gt;Atkin 1980, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Dieppe Canadian War Cemetery]] headstones have been placed back-to-back in double rows, the norm for a German war cemetery but unusual for [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]] sites. When the Allies liberated Dieppe as part of [[Operation Fusilade]] in 1944, the grave markers were replaced but the layout was left unchanged to avoid disturbing the remains.

===Honours and awards===
Three Victoria Crosses were awarded for the operation: one to Captain Patrick Porteous, Royal Regiment of Artillery attached to No. 4 Commando, in the British forces; and two to Canadians – the Reverend [[John Weir Foote]], [[Military Chaplain|padre]] to the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry and Lieutenant Colonel Charles Merritt of the South Saskatchewan Regiment.

Porteous was severely wounded in the battle but was evacuated at the end of the battle; both Foote and Merritt were captured and became [[prisoners of war]], although in the instance of Foote, he deliberately abandoned his landing craft and chose to be captured so that he could minister to his fellow Canadians who were now POWs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/remembrance/history/second-world-war/1942-dieppe-raid|title=The 1942 Dieppe Raid |website=[[Veterans Affairs Canada]] |access-date=4 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcel Lambert of the 14th Army Tank Regiment (The Calgary Regiment (Tank)), fought aggressively in the battle and was captured. He, along with all the participants in the raid, was awarded a "certificate" from the Government of France. In the 1980s the Government of Canada issued to all raid veterans a "volunteer service medal."&lt;ref&gt;Twice-told Tales of St. Albert's Past, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the failure of the operation, Major General Roberts was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.  Among the enlisted personnel, Private William A. Haggard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/canvas/2/cwe462e.html|title=Portrait of Private W. A. Haggard |author= [[Lawren P. Harris]]|date=1942 |website=[[Canadian War Museum]] |access-date=4 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the South Saskatchewan Regiment was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal, and subsequently, field promoted to lieutenant, for his actions during the raid.

A Canadian signalman, Sergeant David Lloyd Hart, was awarded the Military Medal for his efforts during the raid. Hart maintained what became the sole line of radio communications between the men ashore and the commanders out at sea. He is credited with saving the lives of 100 men through his signals work, being able to order their retreat. Hart later became the longest-serving officer in the Canadian Armed Forces, serving in active and honorary roles for 81 years.
