The '''Battle of Pindus''' ({{lang-el|Μάχη της Πίνδου}}) took place in the [[Pindus Mountains]] in [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] and [[West Macedonia]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], from 28 October–13 November 1940. The battle was fought between the [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] armies during the first stages of the [[Greco-Italian War]]. The Italian [[3rd Alpine Division Julia|3rd Alpine Division ''Julia'']] (''Julia'' Division) invaded Greece from the Pindus sector. After its initial advance, the division was surrounded by the Greek army and forced to retreat after suffering heavy losses. In the aftermath, the Greeks were able to push back the Italians, advancing deep into [[Albania under Italy|Albanian]] territory.

==Background==
After the [[Italian invasion of Albania]] in 1939, the Greek General Staff became alerted to a potential Italian attack from Albanian territory, which eventually started on 28 October 1940. The Italian command deployed the ''Julia'' Division with the objective of capturing the strategic mountain passes of the [[Pindus|Pindus Mountains]] as swiftly as possible.{{sfn|Schreiber et al.|1995|p=430}} During an Italian war council, the Italian commander in [[Albanian under Italy|Albania]], General [[Sebastiano Visconti Prasca|Visconti Prasca]], stated that the mountain range of [[Pindus]] would be no problem for the Italian units, and foresaw no difficulty in getting his divisions straight to [[Athens]], like a modern [[Hannibal]].{{sfn|Schreiber et al.|1995|p=412}} The Greeks divided the theatre of operations into the sectors of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] and [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] linked by the Pindus Detachment.{{sfn|Schreiber et al.|1995|p=428}} The [[Konstantinos Davakis#Greco-Italian War|Pindus Detachment]] under Colonel [[Konstantinos Davakis]] was deployed along a {{convert|35|km|mi|adj=on}} line in the [[Pindus]] mountain range.{{sfn|Gedeon|1997|p=31}}

== Battle ==
The primary objective of the [[Julia Division|''Julia'' Division]] was to advance towards the Pindus mountain range and to capture the strategic pass at the town of [[Metsovo]]. This move would have a crucial effect on the outcome of the battle, since it would break the Greek supply lines and separate the Greek forces in Epirus from those in Macedonia. The ''Julia'' managed to cover {{convert|40|km|mi}} of mountain terrain in icy rain and captured the village of [[Vovousa]], but were unable to reach Metsovo. On 2&amp;nbsp;November, Davakis was gravely wounded during a reconnaissance mission near [[Fourka]].{{sfn|Gedeon|1997|p=64}} However, it had become clear to the Italians that they lacked the manpower and the supplies to continue in the face of the arriving Greek reserves.{{sfn|Bauer|2000|p=105}}

On 3 November, the Italian spearhead, after the initial advance, was surrounded from all sides. The commander of the ''Julia'' requested from the Italian headquarters relief attacks and Italian reserves were thrown into the battle. However, reinforcements from Albania were unable to reach the cut-off Italian forces and the ''Julia'' sustained heavy losses. In the meantime, Greek reinforcements were arriving in the Pindus sector, while the assistance of the local population, including men, women, and children, was invaluable.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1943|pp=75, 391}} The situation became difficult for the Italians and their pocket came under pressure from Greek units that had advanced to the area.

The ''Julia'' was eventually able to break out of the encirclement, but lost about one fifth of its force and retreated to [[Koritsa]].{{sfn|Schreiber et al.|1995|p=437}} The villages that had been initially captured during the Italian advance—[[Samarina]] and [[Vovousa]]—were recaptured by the advancing Greek forces on November&amp;nbsp;3–4.{{sfn|Sakellariou|1997|p=391}} Within less than a week, the remaining Italian troops were pushed back into roughly the same positions they occupied along the frontier before the declaration of the war.{{sfn|Schreiber et al.|1995|p=437}}

By 13 November, the entire frontier area had been cleared of Italian units, thereby ending the Battle of Pindus in a complete Greek victory.{{sfn|Gedeon|1997|p=71}} Highly significant for Greek success was the failure of the [[Regia Aeronautica]] to attack and disrupt the mobilization and the deployment of the Greek forces as they moved to the front. Due to this failure to interdict movement, the geographical and technical obstacles faced by the Greeks in transporting men and material in the mountainous terrain to the front lines proved surmountable.{{sfn|Schreiber et al.|1995|p=438}}

==Aftermath==
As a result of the failed invasion, the Italians lost 5,000 men.{{sfn|Jowett|Stephen|2000|p=6}} After the successful Greek defence in Pindus and [[Battle of Elaia–Kalamas|Elea–Kalamas]] sectors, the Greeks were able to push back the Italians, advancing deep into Albanian territory.{{sfn|Willingham|2005|p=114}} It has been argued that the assistance provided by the local women during the conflicts was crucial to the outcome of the battle. The women of the surrounding villages assisted the Greek forces in several ways, while their most important contribution was the transportation of guns, food, clothes and other important supplies to the front, since vehicles could not reach the battlegrounds due to bad weather conditions and rough roads.{{sfn|Mpalaska et al.|2010|pp=23–24}}
