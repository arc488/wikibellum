The '''Battle of Luzon''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Labanan sa Luzon''), was a land battle of the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater of Operations]] of [[World War II]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] of the U.S., its colony the [[Philippines]], and allies against forces of the [[Empire of Japan]]. The battle resulted in a U.S. and Filipino victory. The Allies had taken control of all strategically and economically important locations of Luzon by March 1945, although pockets of Japanese resistance [[Japanese holdout|held out]] in the mountains until the [[Victory over Japan Day|unconditional surrender of Japan]].&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt; While not the highest in U.S. casualties, it is the highest net casualty battle U.S. forces fought in World War II, with 192,000 to 205,000 Japanese combatants dead (mostly from starvation and disease),&lt;ref&gt;Spector, ''Eagle Against the Sun'', p. 529&lt;/ref&gt; 8,000 American combatants killed, and over 150,000 Filipinos, overwhelmingly civilians who were murdered by Japanese forces, mainly during the [[Manila massacre]] of February, 1945.

==Background==
The [[Philippines]] were considered to be of great strategic importance because their capture by Japan would pose a significant threat to the U.S.&lt;!--What significant threat?--&gt; As a result, 135,000 troops and 227 aircraft were stationed in the Philippines by October 1941. However, Luzon—the largest island in the Philippines—was captured by Imperial Japanese forces in 1942. [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]]—who was in charge of the defense of the Philippines at the time—was ordered to Australia, and the remaining U.S. forces retreated to the [[Bataan Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="2ww"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWphilippines.htm |title=The Philippines |accessdate=6 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222190510/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWphilippines.htm |archivedate=22 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months after this, MacArthur expressed his belief that an attempt to recapture the Philippines was necessary. The U.S. Pacific Commander [[Admiral]] [[Chester Nimitz]] and [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Ernest King]] both opposed this idea, arguing that it must wait until victory was certain. MacArthur had to wait two years for his wish; it was 1944 before a campaign to recapture the Philippines was launched. The island of [[Leyte]] was the first objective of the campaign, which was [[Battle of Leyte|captured]] by the end of December 1944. This was followed by the [[Battle of Mindoro|attack on Mindoro]], and later, Luzon.&lt;ref name="2ww"/&gt;

==Prelude==
Before U.S. forces could launch the attack on Luzon, a base of operation needed to be established close to the island. Airbases in particular had to be established in order to provide the advancing troops with [[air support]]. Troops under [[Brigadier General]] William C. Dunckel captured the island of Mindoro, with the assistance of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]]. By 28 December, two airbases were controlled by the U.S. and were ready to assist in the attack on Luzon, which was scheduled to be launched on 9 January 1945. With the capture of Mindoro, U.S. forces were positioned south of Luzon. However, MacArthur intended to land his forces at Lingayen, further north.&lt;ref name="ww2db"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=27 | title= Philippines Campaign, Phase 2 | accessdate= 6 December 2008 | author= C.

===Deception operations===
U.S. aircraft constantly made reconnaissance and bombing flights over southern Luzon, intending to deceive the Japanese forces into believing that the attack on Luzon would come from the south. In addition, transport aircraft were used to make parachute drops with dummies. [[Minesweeper (ship)|Minesweeper]]s were used to clear the bays of Balayan, Batangas, and Tayabas, located to the south of Luzon, and Filipino resistance fighters conducted sabotage operations in southern Luzon. These deception operations failed to convince General Yamashita, the leader of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines, and he built significant defensive positions in the hills and mountains surrounding the Lingayen Gulf in Northern Luzon.&lt;ref name="ww2db"/&gt;

The assault on Luzon was launched, as planned, on 9 January 1945, codenamed S-day. The Japanese forces reported more than 70 Allied warships entering the Lingayen Gulf. Pre-assault bombardment of Japanese shore positions from these ships began at 7:00. The [[Battle of Lingayen Gulf|landings]] were commenced an hour later.&lt;ref name="6in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.6thinfantry.com/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=6&amp;theme=Printer |title=The Battle of Luzon Compared With Other Battles of World War II |accessdate=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The landing forces faced strong opposition from Japanese ''[[kamikaze]]'' aircraft.

The landings at the [[Lingayen Gulf]] on 9 January were carried out by the [[US Sixth Army|6th Army]] under the command of General [[Walter Krueger]]. Approximately 175,000 troops from the 6th Army landed along the {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} beachhead within a few days, while the [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]] protected their flanks. [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]] under General [[Oscar Griswold]] then advanced south toward Manila, despite Krueger's concerns that his eastern flank was unprotected and vulnerable if the Japanese forces attacked. However, no such attack occurred, and the U.S. forces did not meet much resistance until they reached the [[Clark Air Base]] on 23 January. The battle there lasted until the end of January, and after capturing the base, XIV Corps advanced toward Manila.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;
[[File:Coast Guard landing barges at Lingayen Gulf.jpg|thumb|right|The first wave of troops approaching the beaches of Luzon.]]

A second [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious landing]] took place on 15 January, {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Manila. On 31 January, two regiments of the [[11th Airborne Division]] made an airborne assault, capturing a bridge, and later advanced toward Manila. On 3 February, the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] captured the bridge across [[Tullahan River]] leading to the city. They advanced into the city that evening, and the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|battle for the capture of Manila]] began. On 4 February, the paratroopers of the 11th Airborne—approaching the city from the south—came to the main Japanese defences south of the city of Manila where their advance was halted by heavy resistance. General Yamashita had ordered his troops to destroy all bridges and other vital installations as soon as the U.S. forces entered the city, and Japanese forces entrenched throughout the city continued to resist U.S. forces. General MacArthur announced the imminent recapture of Manila on the same day. On 11 February, the 11th Airborne Division captured the last Japanese outer defences, thus encircling the whole city. U.S. and Filipino forces carried out clearing operations in the city in the following weeks.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt; Military casualties totalled 1,010 Americans, 3,079 Filipinos and 12,000 Japanese.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Aftermath==
Battles continued throughout the island of Luzon in the following weeks, with more U.S. troops having landed on the island. Filipino and American resistance fighters also attacked Japanese positions and secured several locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/macarthur/sfeature/bataan_guerrilla.html |title=The Guerrilla War |work=[[American Experience]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate=24 February 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110225031353/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/macarthur/sfeature/bataan_guerrilla.html| archivedate= 25 February 2011 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Allies had taken control of all strategically and economically important locations of Luzon by early March. Small groups of the remaining Japanese forces retreated to the mountainous areas in the north and southeast of the island, where they were besieged for months. Pockets of Japanese soldiers held out in the mountains—most ceasing resistance with the unconditional surrender of Japan, but a scattered few [[Japanese holdout|holding out for many years afterwards]].&lt;ref name= "brochure"/&gt; Casualties were stunningly high for the Japanese. Japanese losses were 205,535 dead, with 9,050 taken prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/thewar/detail_5226.htm |title=The Philippines (Leyte Gulf) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=September 2007 |website=The War |publisher=WETA |access-date=11 April 2017 |quote=The Battle for Luzon cost Japan some 205,535 killed and 9,050 captured.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. losses were far lower, with 8,310 killed and 29,560 wounded.
