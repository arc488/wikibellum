The '''Mogilev Offensive''' ({{lang-ru|Могилевская наступательная операция}}) was part of the Belorussian Strategic Offensive - commonly known as [[Operation Bagration]] - of the [[Red Army]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] of [[World War II]] in the summer of 1944. Its goals were to capture the city of [[Mogilev]], and to pin down and trap the bulk of the [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Fourth Army]]. The offensive fulfilled both objectives.

==Planning==
{{Campaignbox Operation Bagration}}
===Operational goals===
The Mogilev Offensive had two main goals within the context of [[Operation Bagration]]:
*The capture of the city of Mogilev, an important transport hub.
*To pin down the bulk of the German Fourth Army's forces while the parallel [[Vitebsk-Orsha Offensive Operation|Vitebsk-Orsha]] and [[Bobruysk Offensive Operation|Bobruysk]] Offensives, to the north and south respectively, set up a major [[encirclement]]. The Fourth Army, unable to disengage, would be bypassed and trapped.

===German intelligence===
The XXXIX ''Panzer'' Corps before Mogilev was one of the strongest corps in [[Army Group Centre]], with four high-quality divisions. This reflected the strategic importance of the road through Mogilev, which provided the main route through the marshes in the region. However, as with the other German armies involved in [[Operation Bagration]], the Fourth Army was unprepared for a major offensive, as the ''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' expected that the main Soviet offensive would be against [[Army Group North Ukraine]].

Shortly before the attack began, a battalion commander in the [[12th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|12th Infantry Division]] raised concerns about a possible attack with General Martinek, who was on a tour of inspection. Martinek agreed but in response cited the [[proverb]] ''"Whom God would destroy, he first strikes blind"'': the concerns were not passed on.&lt;ref name=Glantz_p219&gt;Glantz, ''When Titans Clashed'', p.219&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deployments==

===Wehrmacht===
*Southern flank of [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourth Army]] (General [[Kurt von Tippelskirch]])
**[[XXXIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXIX Panzer Corps]] (General [[Robert Martinek]])
**[[XII Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XII Corps]] (General [[Vincenz Müller]])
**Reserve: ''[[Panzergrenadier-Division Feldherrnhalle]]''

The city of [[Mogilev]] had been designated a ''Fester Platz'', or fortified area, under the command of [[Generalmajor]] [[Gottfried von Erdmannsdorff]].

===Red Army===
*[[2nd Belorussian Front]] (Colonel-General [[Gyorgy Zakharov]])
**[[33rd Army (Soviet Union)|33rd Army]] (Lieutenant-General [[Vasily Kryuchenkin]]) 
**[[49th Army]] (Lieutenant-General [[Ivan Grishin]])
**[[50th Army (Soviet Union)|50th Army]] (Lieutenant-General [[Ivan Boldin]])
**[[4th Air Army]]

==The offensive==
As with the other offensives in the first phase of [[Operation Bagration]], the Mogilev Offensive opened with an intense artillery barrage against the German defensive lines on the morning of 23 June.

East of Mogilev itself, General [[Robert Martinek]]'s [[XXXIX Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXIX Panzer Corps]] (made up of the [[31st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|31st]], [[12th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|12th]], [[337th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|337th]] and [[German 110th Infantry Division|110th]] Infantry Divisions), attempted to hold its lines in the face of a ferocious assault by Grishin's [[49th Army]] during which the latter suffered heavy casualties.&lt;ref name=dunn163&gt;Dunn, p.163&lt;/ref&gt; The [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourth Army]] commander, von Tippelskirch, requested that Martinek be allowed to withdraw to the 'Tiger' line late on 23 June; this was refused, although the reserve ''[[Panzergrenadier-Division Feldherrnhalle]]'' was ordered forward to take up positions on the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper river]] in preparation to cover a possible withdrawal by the frontline divisions.&lt;ref name=dunn167&gt;Dunn, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; The southernmost German corps, General [[Vincenz Müller]]'s [[XII Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XIIth]], (with the [[18th Panzergrenadier Division (Wehrmacht)|18th Panzergrenadier Division]], [[57th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|57th]] and [[267th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|267th]] Infantry Divisions), also began to pull back to the second defensive line.

The 49th army forced the Dnieper crossings on the evening of 27 June; two divisions (the 290th and the 369th), fought their way into the town during the night, while mobile units of the 23rd Guards Tank Brigade enveloped the garrison from the northwest.&lt;ref name=glantzp95&gt;Glantz, ''Belorussia 1944'', pp. 95-6&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:49th Army troops storming Mogilev June 1944.jpg|thumb|Troops of the 49th Army during the capture of Mogilev on 28 June 1944]]
[[Mogilev]], along with its town commander, [[Gottfried von Erdmannsdorff|Generalmajor von Erdmannsdorff]], (later executed by the Soviets for [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|war crimes]]) and most of the 12th Infantry Division who had been instructed to defend the town to the last man, fell into Soviet hands on 28 June. During the day both the German XII Corps and XXXIX Panzer Corps (whose commander, Martinek, was killed that evening in an air attack), began falling back towards the [[Berezina]] crossings. As the roads were clogged with fleeing civilians and military units, and were also under heavy air attack, progress was slow.

==Consequences==
The Mogilev Offensive fulfilled all its immediate objectives; not only was the city itself taken, but the Fourth Army was successfully prevented from disengaging in time to escape encirclement in the [[Minsk Offensive]], which commenced immediately afterwards.

==Personal accounts==
*Soviet author [[Lev Kopelev]] was served as an interpreter during the offensive and discusses his experiences in ''To Be Preserved Forever'' (Хранить вечно).
*[[Heinz-Georg Lemm]], later a senior officer in the post-war German military, led one of the few units of the 12th Infantry Division to escape the encirclement of Mogilev.
