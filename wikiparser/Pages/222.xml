The '''Battle of the Bulge''', also known as the '''Ardennes Counteroffensive''', was the last major German [[offensive (military)|offensive]] [[military campaign|campaign]] on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] during [[World War II]], and took place from 16 December 1944 to 25 January 1945. It was launched through the densely forested [[Ardennes]] region of [[Wallonia]] in eastern [[Belgium]], northeast [[France]], and [[Luxembourg]], towards the end of the war in Europe. The offensive was intended to stop Allied use of the Belgian [[port of Antwerp]] and to split the Allied lines, allowing the Germans to [[encirclement|encircle and destroy]] four Allied armies and force the Western Allies to negotiate a [[peace treaty]] in the [[Axis powers]]' favor.

The Germans achieved a total surprise attack on the morning of 16 December 1944, due to a combination of Allied overconfidence, preoccupation with Allied offensive plans, and poor [[aerial reconnaissance]] due to bad weather. American forces bore the brunt of the attack and incurred their highest casualties of any operation during the war. The battle also severely depleted Germany's armored forces, and they were largely unable to replace them. German personnel and, later, [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft (in the [[Operation Bodenplatte|concluding stages of the engagement]]) also sustained heavy losses. The Germans had attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line, taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions that grounded the Allies' overwhelmingly superior air forces. Fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive, around [[Battle of Elsenborn Ridge|Elsenborn Ridge]], and in the south, around [[Bastogne]], blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success. Columns of armor and infantry that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads. This, and terrain that favored the defenders, threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops. The farthest west the offensive reached was the village of Foy-Nôtre-Dame, south east of [[Dinant]], being stopped by the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|U.S. 2nd Armored Division]] on 24 December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge; By Hugh M. Cole, pgs 565 – 57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of World War II, Volume 1; By Alan Axelrod, Jack A. Kingston, pg 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Battle of the Bulge; By Turner Publishing Co, pg 55&lt;/ref&gt; Improved weather conditions from around 24 December permitted air attacks on German forces and [[supply line]]s, which sealed the failure of the offensive. On 26 December the lead element of Patton's U.S. Third Army reached Bastogne from the south, ending the siege. Although the offensive was effectively broken by 27 December, when the trapped units of 2nd Panzer Division made two break-out attempts with only partial success, the battle continued for another month before the front line was effectively restored to its position prior to the attack. In the wake of the defeat, many experienced German units were left severely depleted of men and equipment, as survivors retreated to the defenses of the [[Siegfried Line]].

The Germans' initial attack involved 410,000 men; just over 1,400 tanks, tank destroyers, and assault guns; 2,600 artillery pieces; 1,600 anti-tank guns; and over 1,000 combat aircraft, as well as large numbers of other [[armored fighting vehicle]]s (AFVs).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; These were reinforced a couple of weeks later, bringing the offensive's total strength to around 450,000 troops, and 1,500 tanks and assault guns. Between 63,222 and 98,000 of these men were [[Killed in action|killed]], [[Missing in action|missing]], [[wounded in action]], or [[prisoner of war|captured]]. For the Americans, out of a peak of 610,000 troops,{{sfn|Cirillo|2003|p=53}} 89,000{{sfn|Miles|2004}} became casualties out of which some 19,000 were killed.{{sfn|Miles|2004}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=618}} The "Bulge" was the largest and bloodiest single battle fought by the United States in World War II&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=McCullough, David |year=2005 |title=American Experience – The Battle of the Bulge|medium=Videotape}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ambrose1997&gt;{{citation |first=Stephen |last=Ambrose |year=1997 |title=Americans at War |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |page=52 |isbn=978-1-57806-026-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Donald L. |last=Miller |year=2002 |title=The Story of World War II |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=[https://archive.org/details/storyofworldwari00mill/page/358 358] |isbn=978-0-7432-1198-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/storyofworldwari00mill/page/358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[List of battles with most United States military fatalities#Campaigns|third-deadliest campaign in American history]].

==Background==
After the [[Operation Cobra|breakout from Normandy]] at the end of July 1944 and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Operation Dragoon|landings in southern France]] on 15 August 1944, the Allies advanced toward Germany more quickly than anticipated.{{efn|Operation Overlord planned for an advance to the line of the Seine by D+90 (i.e., the 90th day following [[Normandy landings|D-Day]]) and an advance to the German frontier sometime after D+120.}} The Allies faced several [[military logistics]] issues:
* troops were fatigued by weeks of continuous combat
* supply lines were stretched extremely thin
* supplies were dangerously depleted.

[[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Allied Commander]] on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]) and his staff chose to hold the [[Ardennes]] region which was occupied by the [[U.S. First Army]]. The Allies chose to defend the Ardennes with as few troops as possible due to the favorable terrain (a densely wooded highland with deep river valleys and a rather thin road network) and limited Allied operational objectives in the area. They also had intelligence that the [[Wehrmacht]] was using the area across the German border as a rest-and-refit area for its troops.&lt;ref name="Fabianich"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.benning.army.mil/monographs/content/wwii/STUP2/FabianichKeith%20P.%20MAJ.pdf |title=The Operations of the 3rd Battalion, 395th Infantry (99th Infantry Division) Prior to and During the German Counter-Offensive, 10 November – 24 December 1944 (Ardennes Campaign) (Personal Experience of a Company Commander and Battalion Operations Officer) |last=Fabianich |first=Maj.

===Allied supply issues===
The speed of the Allied advance coupled with an initial lack of deep-water ports presented the Allies with enormous supply problems.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=1088–1089}} Over-the-beach supply operations using the Normandy landing areas, and [[Landing Ship, Tank|direct landing ships]] on the beaches, were unable to meet operational needs. The only deep-water port the Allies had captured was [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]] on the northern shore of the [[Cotentin Peninsula|Cotentin peninsula]] and west of the original invasion beaches,{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=1088–1089}} but the Germans had thoroughly wrecked and mined the harbor before it could be taken. It took many months to rebuild its cargo-handling capability. The Allies captured the [[port of Antwerp]] intact in the first days of September, but it was not operational until 28 November. The estuary of the [[Schelde]] river that controlled access to the port had to be cleared of both German troops and [[naval mine]]s.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1086}} These limitations led to differences between General Eisenhower and [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]], commander of the Anglo-Canadian [[21st Army Group]], over whether Montgomery or [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Omar Bradley]], commanding the [[Twelfth United States Army Group|U.S. 12th Army Group]], in the south would get priority access to supplies.{{sfn|Ryan|1995|p=68}} German forces remained in control of several major ports on the [[English Channel]] coast until the end of the war in May 1945.

The Allies' efforts to [[Transport Plan|destroy the French railway system]] prior to [[D-Day]] were successful. This destruction hampered the German response to the invasion, but it proved equally hampering to the Allies, as it took time to repair the rail network's tracks and bridges. A trucking system nicknamed the [[Red Ball Express]] brought supplies to front-line troops, but used up five times as much fuel to reach the front line near the Belgian border. By early October, the Allies had suspended major offensives to improve their supply lines and supply availability at the front.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=1088–1089}}

Montgomery and Bradley both pressed for priority delivery of supplies to their respective armies so they could continue their individual lines of advance and maintain pressure on the Germans, while Eisenhower preferred a broad-front strategy. He gave some priority to Montgomery's northern forces. This had the short-term goal of opening the urgently needed port of Antwerp and the long-term goal of capturing the [[Ruhr|Ruhr area]], the biggest industrial area of Germany.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=1088–1089}} With the Allies stalled, German [[Generalfeldmarschall]] (Field Marshal) [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] was able to reorganize the disrupted German armies into a coherent defensive force.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=1088–1089}}

Field Marshal Montgomery's [[Operation Market Garden]] achieved only some of its objectives, while its territorial gains left the Allied supply situation stretched further than before. In October, the [[First Canadian Army]] fought the [[Battle of the Scheldt]], opening the port of Antwerp to shipping. As a result, by the end of October, the supply situation had eased somewhat.

===German plans===
Despite a lull along the front after the Scheldt battles, the German situation remained dire. While operations continued in the autumn, notably the [[Lorraine Campaign]], the [[Battle of Aachen]] and [[Battle of Hürtgen Forest|fighting in the Hürtgen Forest]], the strategic situation in the west had changed little. The Allies were [[Operation Queen|slowly pushing towards Germany]], but no decisive breakthrough was achieved. The Western Allies already had 96 divisions at or near the front, with an estimated ten more divisions en route from the United Kingdom. Additional Allied airborne units remained in England. The Germans could field a total of 55 understrength divisions.&lt;ref name=Cole1964&gt;{{citation |last=Cole |first=Hugh M. |authorlink=Hugh M. Cole |title=The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge |publisher=Office of the Chief of Military History Department of the Army |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/007/7-8-1/CMH_Pub_7-8-1.pdf |year=1964 |lccn=65060001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

Adolf Hitler first officially outlined his surprise counter-offensive to his astonished generals on September 16, 1944. The assault's ambitious goal was to pierce the thinly held lines of the U.S. First Army between Monschau and Wasserbillig with [[Army Group B]] ([[Walter Model|Model]]) by the end of the first day, get the armor through the Ardennes by the end of the second day, reach the [[Meuse]] between [[Liège]] and Dinant by the third day, and seize Antwerp and the western bank of the Scheldt estuary by the fourth day.&lt;ref name=Cole&gt;{{citation | last = Cole | first = Hugh M. | authorlink = Hugh M.

P. |last=von Luttchau |publisher=U.S. Army Center for Military History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler initially promised his generals a total of 18 infantry and 12 armored or mechanized divisions "for planning purposes." The plan was to pull 13 infantry divisions, two parachute divisions and six panzer-type divisions from the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] combined German military strategic reserve. On the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the Soviets' [[Operation Bagration]] during the summer had destroyed much of Germany's [[Army Group Center]] (Heeresgruppe Mitte). The extremely swift operation ended only when the advancing [[Red Army|Soviet Red Army]] forces outran their supplies. By November, it was clear that Soviet forces were preparing for a winter offensive.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1085}}

Meanwhile, the Allied air offensive of early 1944 had effectively grounded the [[Luftwaffe]], leaving the German Army with little battlefield intelligence and no way to interdict Allied supplies. The converse was equally damaging; daytime movement of German forces was rapidly noticed, and interdiction of supplies combined with the bombing of the [[Petrochemical industry in Romania|Romanian oil fields]] starved Germany of oil and gasoline. This fuel shortage intensified after the Soviets overran those fields in the course of their August 1944 [[Jassy-Kishinev Offensive]].

One of the few advantages held by the German forces in November 1944 was that they were no longer defending all of Western Europe. Their front lines in the west had been considerably shortened by the Allied offensive and were much closer to the German heartland. This drastically reduced their supply problems despite Allied control of the air. Additionally, their extensive telephone and telegraph network meant that radios were no longer necessary for communications, which lessened the effectiveness of Allied [[Ultra]] intercepts. Nevertheless, some 40–50 messages per day were decrypted by Ultra. They recorded the quadrupling of German fighter forces and a term used in an intercepted Luftwaffe message—Jägeraufmarsch (literally "Hunter Deployment")—implied preparation for an offensive operation. Ultra also picked up communiqués regarding extensive rail and road movements in the region, as well as orders that movements should be made on time.{{sfn|Parker|1994|pp=122–123}}

===Drafting the offensive===
Hitler felt that his mobile reserves allowed him to mount one major offensive. Although he realized nothing significant could be accomplished in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], he still believed an offensive against the Western Allies, whom he considered militarily inferior to the Red Army, would have some chances of success.{{sfn|Weinberg|1964}} Hitler believed he could split the Allied forces and compel the Americans and British to settle for a separate peace, independent of the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1091}} Success in the west would give the Germans time to design and produce more advanced weapons (such as [[jet aircraft]], new [[U-boat]] designs and [[super-heavy tank]]s) and permit the concentration of forces in the east. After the war ended, this assessment was generally viewed as unrealistic, given Allied air superiority throughout Europe and their ability to continually disrupt German offensive operations.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1092}}

Hitler's plan called for a [[Blitzkrieg]] attack through the weakly defended Ardennes, mirroring the successful German offensive there during the [[Battle of France]] in 1940—aimed at splitting the armies along the U.S.—British lines and capturing Antwerp.&lt;ref name="cole"&gt;{{cite book| series = United States Army in World War II, The European Theater of Operations| title = The Ardennes| first = Hugh M.| last = Cole| publisher=[[Office of the Chief of Military History]]| location= Washington, D.C.| year = 1965 |chapterurl = http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/7-8/7-8_5.htm| chapter = Chapter V: The Sixth Panzer Army Attack}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan banked on unfavorable weather, including heavy fog and low-lying clouds, which would minimize the Allied air advantage.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1090}} Hitler originally set the offensive for late November, before the anticipated start of the [[Vistula-Oder Offensive|Russian winter offensive]]. The disputes between Montgomery and Bradley were well known, and Hitler hoped he could exploit this disunity. If the attack were to succeed in capturing Antwerp, four complete armies would be trapped without supplies behind German lines.&lt;ref name=cole/&gt;{{rp|19}}

Several senior German military officers, including Generalfeldmarschall [[Walter Model]] and [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], expressed concern as to whether the goals of the offensive could be realized. Model and von Rundstedt both believed aiming for Antwerp was too ambitious, given Germany's scarce resources in late 1944. At the same time, they felt that maintaining a purely defensive posture (as had been the case since Normandy) would only delay defeat, not avert it. They thus developed alternative, less ambitious plans that did not aim to cross the [[Meuse River]] (in German and Dutch: Maas); Model's being [[Operation Herbstnebel (Northwest Europe)|Unternehmen Herbstnebel]] (Operation Autumn Mist) and von Rundstedt's [[Fall Martin]] ("Plan Martin"). The two field marshals combined their plans to present a joint "small solution" to Hitler.{{efn|The Ardennes offensive was also named Rundstedt-Offensive, but von Rundstedt strongly objected "to the fact that this stupid operation in the Ardennes is sometimes called the 'Rundstedt-Offensive'. This is a complete misnomer. I had nothing to do with it. It came to me as an order complete to the last detail. Hitler had even written on the plan in his own handwriting 'not to be altered'". ({{citation |last=Jablonsky |first=David |title=Churchill and Hitler: Essays on the Political-Military Direction of Total War |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1994 |page=194 |isbn=978-0-7146-4119-5}}).}}{{efn|Wacht am Rhein was renamed Herbstnebel after the operation was given the go-ahead in early December, although its original name remains much better known ({{Harvnb|Parker|1991|pp=95–100}}; {{Harvnb|Mitcham|2006|p=38}}; {{Harvnb|Newton|2006|pp=329–334}}).}} When they offered their alternative plans, Hitler would not listen. Rundstedt later testified that while he recognized the merit of Hitler's operational plan, he saw from the very first that "all, absolutely all conditions for the possible success of such an offensive were lacking."&lt;ref name=cole/&gt;{{rp|24}}

Model, commander of German Army Group B (Heeresgruppe B), and von Rundstedt, overall commander of the German [[OB West|Army Command in the West]] (OB West), were put in charge of carrying out the operation.

In the west supply problems began significantly to impede Allied operations, even though the opening of the port of Antwerp in late November improved the situation somewhat. The positions of the Allied armies stretched from southern France all the way north to the Netherlands. German planning for the counteroffensive rested on the premise that a successful strike against thinly manned stretches of the line would halt Allied advances on the entire Western Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/wwii/nordwind-the-other-battle-of-the-bulge/|title=Operation Nordwind: The "Other" Battle of the Bulge|website=warfarehistorynetwork.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation names===
The [[Wehrmacht]]{{'}}s code name for the offensive was ''Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein'' ("Operation Watch on the Rhine"), after the German patriotic hymn ''[[Die Wacht am Rhein]],'' a name that deceptively implied the Germans would be adopting a defensive posture along the Western Front. The Germans also referred to it as "Ardennenoffensive" (Ardennes Offensive) and Rundstedt-Offensive, both names being generally used nowadays in modern Germany.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The French (and Belgian) name for the operation is Bataille des Ardennes (Battle of the Ardennes). The battle was militarily defined by the Allies as the Ardennes Counteroffensive, which included the German drive and the American effort to contain and later defeat it. The phrase Battle of the Bulge was coined by contemporary press to describe the way the Allied front line bulged inward on wartime news maps.{{sfn|Cirillo|2003|p=4}}{{sfn|Stanton|2006|}}

While the Ardennes Counteroffensive is the correct term in Allied military language, the official Ardennes-Alsace campaign reached beyond the Ardennes battle region, and the most popular description in English speaking countries remains simply the Battle of the Bulge.

The [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]] decided by mid-September, at Hitler's insistence, that the offensive would be mounted in the Ardennes, as was done [[Battle of France|in 1940]]. In 1940 German forces had passed through the Ardennes in three days before engaging the enemy, but the 1944 plan called for battle in the forest itself. The main forces were to advance westward to the Meuse River, then turn northwest for Antwerp and [[Brussels]]. The close terrain of the Ardennes would make rapid movement difficult, though open ground beyond the Meuse offered the prospect of a successful dash to the coast.

Four armies were selected for the operation. Adolf Hitler personally selected for the counter-offensive on the northern shoulder of the western front the best troops available and officers he trusted. The lead role in the attack was given to [[6th Panzer Army]], commanded by SS-''Oberstgruppenführer'' [[Sepp Dietrich]]. It included the most experienced formation of the [[Waffen-SS]]: the [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler]]. It also contained the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]]. They were given priority for supply and equipment and assigned the shortest route to the primary objective of the offensive, Antwerp,&lt;ref name=Cole/&gt;{{rp|1–64}} starting from the northernmost point on the intended battlefront, nearest the important road network hub of [[Monschau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Hugh M.|title=THE ARDENNES: BATTLE OF THE BULGE|url=https://archive.org/details/ardennesbattlebu00cole|url-access=limited|date=1965|publisher=OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF MILITARY HISTORY DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY|location=Washington, D.C.|page=[https://archive.org/details/ardennesbattlebu00cole/page/n112 86]|edition=LC: 65-60001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[5th Panzer Army|Fifth Panzer Army]] under General [[Hasso von Manteuffel]] was assigned to the middle sector with the objective of capturing Brussels. The [[7th Army (Wehrmacht)|Seventh Army]], under General [[Erich Brandenberger]], was assigned to the southernmost sector, near the Luxembourgish city of [[Echternach]], with the task of protecting the flank. This Army was made up of only four infantry divisions, with no large-scale armored formations to use as a spearhead unit. As a result, they made little progress throughout the battle.

[[File:German Wacht Am Rhein Offensive Plan.png|thumb|upright=1.6|left|The German plan]]

Also participating in a secondary role was the [[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fifteenth Army]], under General [[Gustav-Adolf von Zangen]]. Recently brought back up to strength and re-equipped after heavy fighting during Operation Market Garden, it was located on the far north of the Ardennes battlefield and tasked with holding U.S. forces in place, with the possibility of launching its own attack given favorable conditions.

For the offensive to be successful, four criteria were deemed critical: the attack had to be a complete surprise; the weather conditions had to be poor to neutralize Allied [[air superiority]] and the damage it could inflict on the German offensive and its supply lines;{{sfn|Parker|1994|p=118}} the progress had to be rapid—the Meuse River, halfway to Antwerp, had to be reached by day 4; and Allied fuel supplies would have to be captured intact along the way because the combined Wehrmacht forces were short on fuel. The General Staff estimated they only had enough fuel to cover one third to one half of the ground to Antwerp in heavy combat conditions.

The plan originally called for just under 45 divisions, including a dozen [[panzer division|panzer]] and ''[[Panzergrenadier]]'' divisions forming the [[armored spearhead]] and various infantry units to form a defensive line as the battle unfolded. By this time the German Army suffered from an acute manpower shortage, and the force had been reduced to around 30 divisions. Although it retained most of its armor, there were not enough infantry units because of the defensive needs in the East. These 30 newly rebuilt divisions used some of the last reserves of the German Army. Among them were ''[[Volksgrenadier]]'' ("People's Grenadier") units formed from a mix of battle-hardened veterans and recruits formerly regarded as too young, too old or too frail to fight. Training time, equipment and supplies were inadequate during the preparations. German fuel supplies were precarious—those materials and supplies that could not be directly transported by rail had to be horse-drawn to conserve fuel, and the mechanized and panzer divisions would depend heavily on captured fuel. As a result, the start of the offensive was delayed from 27 November to 16 December.{{citation needed | date = August 2010}}

Before the offensive the Allies were virtually blind to German troop movement. During the liberation of France, the extensive network of the [[French Resistance]] had provided valuable intelligence about German dispositions. Once they reached the German border, this source dried up. In France, orders had been relayed within the German army using radio messages enciphered by the [[Enigma machine]], and these could be picked up and decrypted by Allied code-breakers headquartered at [[Bletchley Park]], to give the intelligence known as [[Ultra]]. In Germany such orders were typically transmitted using telephone and [[teleprinter]], and a special [[radio silence]] order was imposed on all matters concerning the upcoming offensive.{{sfn|MacDonald|1984|p=40}} The major crackdown in the Wehrmacht after the [[20 July plot]] to assassinate Hitler resulted in much tighter security and fewer leaks. The foggy autumn weather also prevented Allied reconnaissance aircraft from correctly assessing the ground situation. German units assembling in the area were even issued charcoal instead of wood for cooking fires to cut down on smoke and reduce chances of Allied observers deducing a troop buildup was underway.{{sfn|Cole|1964|p=21}}

For these reasons Allied High Command considered the Ardennes a quiet sector, relying on assessments from their intelligence services that the Germans were unable to launch any major offensive operations this late in the war. What little intelligence they had led the Allies to believe precisely what the Germans wanted them to believe-–that preparations were being carried out only for defensive, not offensive, operations. The Allies relied too much on Ultra, not human reconnaissance. In fact, because of the Germans' efforts, the Allies were led to believe that a new defensive army was being formed around [[Düsseldorf]] in the northern Rhineland, possibly to defend against British attack. This was done by increasing the number of [[flak]] ('''Fl'''ug'''a'''bwehr'''k'''anonen, i.e., anti-aircraft cannons) in the area and the artificial multiplication of radio transmissions in the area. The Allies at this point thought the information was of no importance. All of this meant that the attack, when it came, completely surprised the Allied forces. Remarkably, the U.S. Third Army intelligence chief, Colonel [[Oscar Koch]], the U.S. First Army intelligence chief and the SHAEF intelligence officer Brigadier General [[Kenneth Strong]] all correctly predicted the German offensive capability and intention to strike the U.S. VIII Corps area. These predictions were largely dismissed by the U.S. 12th Army Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dougherty |first=Kevin |year=2002 |url=https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/mipb/2002_04.pdf |title=Oscar Koch: An Unsung Hero Behind Patton's Victories |journal=Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin April–June 2002 |pages=64–66 |volume=28 |issue=1 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong had informed [[Walter Bedell Smith|Bedell Smith]] in December of his suspicions. Bedell Smith sent Strong to warn Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, the commander of the 12th Army Group, of the danger. Bradley's response was succinct: "Let them come."&lt;ref name=Pogue1954&gt;{{cite book |work=United States Army in World War II European Theater of Operations |title=The Supreme Command |first1=Forrest C. |last1= Pogue |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/007/7-1/CMH_Pub_7-1.pdf |year=1954 |page=607}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|362–366}} Historian Patrick K. O'Donnell writes that on 8 December 1944 U.S. Rangers at great cost took Hill 400 during the Battle of the Hürtgen Forest. The next day GIs who relieved the Rangers reported a considerable movement of German troops inside the Ardennes in the enemy's rear, but that no one in the chain of command connected the dots.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell Patrick K., ''Dog Company: The Boys of Pointe du Hoc—the Rangers Who Accomplished D-Day's Toughest Mission and Led the Way across Europe'', Da Capo Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Ardennes was considered a quiet sector, considerations of [[economy of force]] led it to be used as a training ground for new units and a rest area for units that had seen hard fighting. The U.S. units deployed in the Ardennes thus were a mixture of inexperienced troops (such as the raw U.S. [[99th Infantry Division (United States)|99th]] and [[106th Infantry Division (United States)|106th "Golden Lions" Divisions]]), and battle-hardened troops sent to that sector to recuperate (the [[28th Infantry Division (United States)|28th Infantry Division]]).

Two major [[special operations]] were planned for the offensive. By October it was decided that [[Otto Skorzeny]], the German SS-commando who [[Gran Sasso raid|had rescued]] the former Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], was to lead a task force of English-speaking German soldiers in "[[Operation Greif]]". These soldiers were to be dressed in American and British uniforms and wear [[dog tag (identifier)|dog tags]] taken from corpses and prisoners of war. Their job was to go behind American lines and change signposts, misdirect traffic, generally cause disruption and seize bridges across the Meuse River. By late November another ambitious special operation was added: Col. [[Friedrich August von der Heydte]] was to lead a [[Fallschirmjäger (Nazi Germany)|''Fallschirmjäger'']]-''[[Kampfgruppe]]'' (paratrooper combat group) in [[Operation Stösser]], a night-time paratroop drop behind the Allied lines aimed at capturing a vital road junction near [[Malmedy]].{{sfn | MacDonald|1984|pp=86–89}}{{sfn | Toland|1999|p=16, 19}}

German intelligence had set 20 December as the expected date for the start of the [[Vistula–Oder Offensive|upcoming Soviet offensive]], aimed at crushing what was left of German resistance on the Eastern Front and thereby opening the way to Berlin. It was hoped that Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] would delay the start of the operation once the German assault in the Ardennes had begun and wait for the outcome before continuing.

After the 20 July attempt on Hitler's life, and the close advance of the Red Army which would seize the site on 27 January 1945, Hitler and his staff had been forced to abandon the [[Wolfsschanze]] headquarters in [[East Prussia]], in which they had coordinated much of the fighting on the Eastern Front. After a brief visit to Berlin, Hitler traveled on his ''[[Führersonderzug]]'' ("Special Train of the Führer" (Leader)) to [[Giessen]] on 11 December, taking up residence in the [[Adlerhorst]] (eyrie) command complex, co-located with OB West's base at Kransberg Castle. Believing in omens and the successes of his early war campaigns that had been planned at Kransberg, Hitler had chosen the site from which he had overseen the successful 1940 campaign against France and the Low Countries.

Von Rundstedt set up his operational headquarters near [[Limburg an der Lahn|Limburg]], close enough for the generals and Panzer Corps commanders who were to lead the attack to visit Adlerhorst on 11 December, traveling there in an SS-operated bus convoy. With the castle acting as overflow accommodation, the main party was settled into the Adlerhorst's Haus 2 command bunker, including Gen. [[Alfred Jodl]], Gen. [[Wilhelm Keitel]], Gen. [[Günther Blumentritt|Blumentritt]], von Manteuffel and SS Gen. Joseph ("Sepp") Dietrich.

In a personal conversation on 13 December between Walter Model and [[Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte|Friedrich von der Heydte]], who was put in charge of Operation Stösser, von der Heydte gave Operation Stösser less than a 10% chance of succeeding. Model told him it was necessary to make the attempt: "It must be done because this offensive is the last chance to conclude the war favorably."{{sfn|Parker|2004|p=132}}

==Initial German assault==
[[File:Western Front Ardennes 1944.jpg|thumb|Situation on the Western Front as of 15 December 1944]]

On 16 December 1944 at 05:30, the Germans began the assault with a massive, 90-minute artillery barrage using 1,600 artillery pieces{{sfn|Quarrie|1999|p=}} across a {{convert|80|mi|adj=on|order=flip|sp=us}} front on the Allied troops facing the 6th Panzer Army. The Americans' initial impression was that this was the anticipated, localized counterattack resulting from the Allies' recent attack in the [[Battle of Elsenborn Ridge#Battle of Heartbreak Crossroads|Wahlerscheid]] sector to the north, where the 2nd Division had knocked a sizable dent in the Siegfried Line. Heavy snowstorms engulfed parts of the Ardennes area. While having the effect of keeping the Allied aircraft grounded, the weather also proved troublesome for the Germans because poor road conditions hampered their advance. Poor traffic control led to massive traffic jams and fuel shortages in forward units.

In the center, von Manteuffel's Fifth Panzer Army attacked towards [[Bastogne]] and [[St. Vith]], both road junctions of great strategic importance. In the south, Brandenberger's Seventh Army pushed towards [[Luxembourg]] in its efforts to secure the flank from Allied attacks.

===German forces held up===
[[File:Battle of the Bulge 6th.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.6|Sepp Dietrich led the Sixth Panzer Army in the northernmost attack route.]]

The attacks by the Sixth Panzer Army's infantry units in the north fared badly because of unexpectedly fierce resistance by the U.S. 2nd and 99th Infantry Divisions. ''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper, at the head of Sepp Dietrich's Sixth Panzer Army, had been designated to take the Losheim-Losheimergraben road, a key route through the [[Losheim Gap]], but it was closed by two collapsed overpasses that German engineers failed to repair during the first day.{{sfn | Cole|1964|p=83}} Peiper's forces were rerouted through [[Battle of Lanzerath Ridge|Lanzerath]].

To preserve the quantity of armor available, the infantry of the 9th ''Fallschirmjaeger'' Regiment, [[3rd Parachute Division (Germany)|3rd ''Fallschirmjaeger'' Division]], had been ordered to clear the village first. A single 18-man [[ISTAR|Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon]] from the [[99th Infantry Division (United States)#Most decorated platoon of World War II|99th Infantry Division]] along with four Forward Air Controllers held up the battalion of about 500 German paratroopers until sunset, about 16:00, causing 92 casualties among the Germans.

This created a bottleneck in the German advance. ''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper did not begin his advance until nearly 16:00, more than 16 hours behind schedule and didn't reach Bucholz Station until the early morning of 17 December. Their intention was to control the twin villages of Rocherath-Krinkelt which would clear a path to the high ground of Elsenborn Ridge. Occupation of this dominating terrain would allow control of the roads to the south and west and ensure supply to ''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper's armored task force.

===Malmedy massacre===
{{Main|Malmedy massacre}}
[[File:Malmedy Massacre.jpg|thumb|Scene of the [[Malmedy massacre]]]]

At 12:30 on 17 December, ''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper was near the hamlet of [[Baugnez]], on the height halfway between the town of [[Malmedy]] and Ligneuville, when they encountered elements of the [[285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion]], [[7th Armored Division (United States)|U.S. 7th Armored Division]].{{sfn|Cole|1964|pp=75–106}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1984}} After a brief battle the lightly armed Americans surrendered. They were disarmed and, with some other Americans captured earlier (approximately 150 men), sent to stand in a field near the crossroads under light guard. About fifteen minutes after Peiper's advance guard passed through, the main body under the command of SS-''[[Sturmbannführer]]'' [[Werner Pötschke]] arrived. The SS troopers suddenly opened fire on the prisoners. As soon as the firing began, the prisoners panicked. Most were shot where they stood, though some managed to flee. Accounts of the killing vary, but at least 84 of the [[Prisoner of War|POWs]] were murdered. A few survived, and news of the killings of prisoners of war spread through Allied lines.{{sfn|MacDonald|1984}} Following the end of the war, soldiers and officers of ''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper, including [[Joachim Peiper]] and SS general Sepp Dietrich, were tried for the incident at the [[Malmedy massacre trial]].{{sfn|Toland|1999|p=382}}

===Kampfgruppe Peiper deflected southeast===
Driving to the south-east of Elsenborn, ''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper entered Honsfeld, where they encountered one of the 99th Division's rest centers, clogged with confused American troops. They quickly captured portions of the 3rd Battalion of the [[394th Infantry Regiment (United States)|394th Infantry Regiment]]. They destroyed a number of American armored units and vehicles, and took several dozen prisoners who were subsequently murdered.{{sfn|MacDonald|1984|p=210}}{{sfn|Cole|1964|pp=75–106}}&lt;ref name="Judge1"&gt;{{citation |title=Review and Recommendation of the Deputy Judge Advocate for War Crimes |date=20 October 1947 |pages=4–22 |url=http://137.248.11.66/attachments?lang=de&amp;barcode=06-024 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peiper also captured {{convert|50000|gal}} of fuel for his vehicles.&lt;ref name="Hersko"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-the-bulge-us-troops-fight-at-elsenburn-ridge.htm/1 |title=Battle of the Bulge: U.S. Troops Fight at Elsenborn Ridge |publisher=HistoryNet.com |last=Hersko |first=Ralph E., Jr. |date=November 1998 |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peiper advanced north-west towards [[Büllingen]], keeping to the plan to move west, unaware that if he had turned north he had an opportunity to flank and trap the entire 2nd and 99th Divisions.{{sfn|Quarrie|1999|p=31}} Instead, intent on driving west, Peiper turned south to detour around Hünningen, choosing a route designated Rollbahn D as he had been given latitude to choose the best route west.{{sfn|Quarrie|1999}}

To the north, the [[277th Volksgrenadier Division (Wehrmacht)|277th Volksgrenadier Division]] attempted to break through the defending line of the U.S. 99th and the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Divisions]]. The [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend|12th SS Panzer Division]], reinforced by additional infantry (Panzergrenadier and Volksgrenadier) divisions, took the key road junction at [[Büllingen|Losheimergraben]] just north of Lanzerath and attacked the twin villages of Rocherath and Krinkelt.

===Germans advance west===

By the evening the spearhead had pushed north to engage the U.S. 99th Infantry Division and ''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper arrived in front of [[Stavelot]]. Peiper's forces were already behind his timetable because of the stiff American resistance and because when the Americans fell back, their engineers blew up bridges and emptied fuel dumps. Peiper's unit was delayed and his vehicles denied critically needed fuel. They took 36 hours to advance from the [[Eifel]] region to Stavelot, while the same advance required nine hours in 1940.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}

''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper attacked Stavelot on 18 December but was unable to capture the town before the Americans evacuated a large fuel depot.{{sfn|Bouwmeester|2004|p=106}} Three tanks attempted to take the bridge, but the lead vehicle was disabled by a mine. Following this, 60 grenadiers advanced forward but were stopped by concentrated American defensive fire. After a fierce tank battle the next day, the Germans finally entered the town when U.S. engineers failed to blow the bridge.

[[File:GERMAN TROOPS ADVANCING PAST ABANDONED AMERICAN EQUIPMENT.jpg|thumb|German troops advancing past abandoned American equipment]]
Capitalizing on his success and not wanting to lose more time, Peiper rushed an advance group toward the vital bridge at [[Trois-Ponts]], leaving the bulk of his strength in Stavelot. When they reached it at 11:30 on 18 December, retreating U.S. engineers blew it up.{{sfn|Bouwmeester|2004|p=107}}{{sfn|Toland|1999|p=103, 104}} Peiper detoured north towards the villages of [[La Gleize]] and Cheneux. At Cheneux, the advance guard was attacked by American fighter-bombers, destroying two tanks and five halftracks, blocking the narrow road. The group began moving again at dusk at 16:00 and was able to return to its original route at around 18:00. Of the two bridges remaining between ''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper and the Meuse, the bridge over the Lienne was blown by the Americans as the Germans approached. Peiper turned north and halted his forces in the woods between La Gleize and [[Stoumont]].{{sfn|Bouwmeester|2004|p=108}} He learned that Stoumont was strongly held and that the Americans were bringing up strong reinforcements from [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]].

To Peiper's south, the advance of ''Kampfgruppe'' Hansen had stalled. SS-''Oberführer'' [[Wilhelm Mohnke|Mohnke]] ordered ''Schnellgruppe'' Knittel, which had been designated to follow Hansen, to instead move forward to support Peiper. SS-''Sturmbannführer'' Knittel crossed the bridge at Stavelot around 19:00 against American forces trying to retake the town. Knittel pressed forward towards La Gleize, and shortly afterward the Americans recaptured Stavelot. Peiper and Knittel both faced the prospect of being cut off.{{sfn|Bouwmeester|2004|p=108}}

===German advance halted===

At dawn on 19 December, Peiper surprised the American defenders of Stoumont by sending infantry from the 2nd SS Panzergrenadier Regiment in an attack and a company of Fallschirmjäger to infiltrate their lines. He followed this with a Panzer attack, gaining the eastern edge of the town. An American tank battalion arrived but, after a two-hour tank battle, Peiper finally captured Stoumont at 10:30. Knittel joined up with Peiper and reported the Americans had recaptured Stavelot to their east.{{sfn|Bouwmeester|2004|p=109}} Peiper ordered Knittel to retake Stavelot. Assessing his own situation, he determined that his ''Kampfgruppe'' did not have sufficient fuel to cross the bridge west of Stoumont and continue his advance. He maintained his lines west of Stoumont for a while, until the evening of 19 December when he withdrew them to the village edge. On the same evening the U.S. [[82nd Airborne Division]] under Maj. Gen. [[James M. Gavin|James Gavin]] arrived and deployed at La Gleize and along Peiper's planned route of advance.{{sfn|Bouwmeester|2004|p=109}}

German efforts to reinforce Peiper were unsuccessful. ''Kampfgruppe'' Hansen was still struggling against bad road conditions and stiff American resistance on the southern route. ''Schnellgruppe'' Knittel was forced to disengage from the heights around Stavelot. ''Kampfgruppe'' Sandig, which had been ordered to take Stavelot, launched another attack without success. Sixth Panzer Army commander Sepp Dietrich ordered [[Hermann Priess]], commanding officer of the I SS Panzer Corps, to increase its efforts to back Peiper's battle group, but Prieß was unable to break through.{{sfn|Bouwmeester|2004|p=111}}

[[File:Stoumont JPG02.jpg|thumb|left|Froidcourt castle near Stoumont in 2011]]

Small units of the U.S. 2nd Battalion, [[119th Infantry Regiment (United States)|119th Infantry Regiment]], 30th Infantry Division, attacked the dispersed units of ''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper on the morning of 21 December. They failed and were forced to withdraw, and a number were captured, including battalion commander Maj. [[Hal D. McCown]]. Peiper learned that his reinforcements had been directed to gather in La Gleize to his east, and he withdrew, leaving wounded Americans and Germans in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Froidcourt Castle|fr|3=Château de Froidcourt}}. As he withdrew from Cheneux, American paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division engaged the Germans in fierce house-to-house fighting. The Americans shelled ''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper on 22 December, and although the Germans had run out of food and had virtually no fuel, they continued to fight. A Luftwaffe resupply mission went badly when SS-''Brigadeführer'' Wilhelm Mohnke insisted the grid coordinates supplied by Peiper were wrong, parachuting supplies into American hands in Stoumont.{{sfn|Bouwmeester|2004|p=112}}

In La Gleize, Peiper set up defenses waiting for German relief. When the relief force was unable to penetrate the Allied lines, he decided to break through the Allied lines and return to the German lines on 23 December. The men of the ''Kampfgruppe'' were forced to abandon their vehicles and heavy equipment, although most of the 800 remaining troops were able to escape.{{sfn|MacDonald|1984|p=461, 463}}

===Outcome===
[[File:Captured German Panther tank crewman 1944.jpg|thumb|An American soldier escorts a German crewman from his wrecked Panther tank during the Battle of Elsenborn Ridge.]]

The U.S. 99th Infantry Division, outnumbered five to one, inflicted casualties in the ratio of 18 to one. The division lost about 20% of its effective strength, including 465 killed and 2,524 evacuated due to wounds, injuries, fatigue, or trench foot. German losses were much higher. In the northern sector opposite the 99th, this included more than 4,000 deaths and the destruction of 60 tanks and big guns.&lt;ref name="dean"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/articles/hofendefense.aspx |title=Why the Bulge Didn't Break: Green Troops Grew Up Fast to Become Heroes of Hofen |last=Dean |first=Rob |work=American Forces in World War II |publisher=Military History Online |accessdate=17 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225230026/http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/articles/hofendefense.aspx|archivedate=25 February 2009 |url-status = live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[John S.

The stiff American defense prevented the Germans from reaching the vast array of supplies near the Belgian cities of [[Liège]] and Spa and the road network west of the Elsenborn Ridge leading to the Meuse River.{{sfn | Cole|1964|pp=259–260}} After more than 10 days of intense battle, they pushed the Americans out of the villages, but were unable to dislodge them from the ridge, where elements of the [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] of the [[First U.S. Army]] prevented the German forces from reaching the road network to their west.

===Operation Stösser===
{{Main|Operation Stösser}}
Operation Stösser was a paratroop drop into the American rear in the [[High Fens]] ({{lang-fr|link=no|Hautes Fagnes}}; {{lang-de|link=no|Hohes Venn}}; {{lang-nl|Hoge Venen}}) area. The objective was the "[[Baraque Michel]]" crossroads. It was led by [[Oberst]] [[Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte]], considered by Germans to be a hero of the [[Battle of Crete]].{{sfn|Goldstein|Dillon|Wenger|1994|p=88}}

It was the German paratroopers' only night time drop during World War II. Von der Heydte was given only eight days to prepare prior to the assault. He was not allowed to use his own regiment because their movement might alert the Allies to the impending counterattack. Instead, he was provided with a ''Kampfgruppe'' of 800 men. The [[2nd Parachute Corps (Germany)|II Parachute Corps]] was tasked with contributing 100 men from each of its regiments. In loyalty to their commander, 150 men from von der Heydte's own unit, the [[6th Parachute Division (Germany)|6th Parachute Regiment]], went against orders and joined him.{{sfn|Parker|2004|p=130}} They had little time to establish any [[unit cohesion]] or train together.

The parachute drop was a complete failure. Von der Heydte ended up with a total of around 300 troops. Too small and too weak to counter the Allies, they abandoned plans to take the crossroads and instead converted the mission to reconnaissance. With only enough ammunition for a single fight, they withdrew towards Germany and attacked the rear of the American lines. Only about 100 of his weary men finally reached the German rear.{{sfn|Parker|2004|p=137}}

===Chenogne massacre===
{{Main|Chenogne massacre}}
Following the Malmedy massacre, on New Year's Day 1945, after having previously received orders to take no prisoners,{{sfn|Schrijvers|2005|p=303f}} American soldiers murdered approximately sixty German prisoners of war near the Belgian village of [[Chenogne]] (8&amp;nbsp;km from Bastogne).{{sfn|Sorge|1986|p=147}}

==Attack in the center==
{{Wikisource|The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge/Chapter XVII|St. Vith is lost}}
[[File:Battle of the Bulge 5th.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Hasso von Manteuffel]] led the Fifth Panzer Army in the middle attack route.]]

The Germans fared better in the center (the {{convert|20|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} Schnee Eifel sector) as the Fifth Panzer Army attacked positions held by the U.S. 28th and 106th Infantry Divisions. The Germans lacked the overwhelming strength that had been deployed in the north, but still possessed a marked numerical and material superiority over the very thinly spread 28th and 106th divisions. They succeeded in surrounding two largely intact regiments (422nd and 423rd) of the 106th Division in a [[pincer movement]] and forced their surrender, a tribute to the way Manteuffel's new tactics had been applied.{{sfn|Liddell Hart|1970|p=653}} The official U.S. Army history states: "At least seven thousand [men] were lost here and the figure probably is closer to eight or nine thousand. The amount lost in arms and equipment, of course, was very substantial. The Schnee Eifel battle, therefore, represents the most serious reverse suffered by American arms during the operations of 1944–45 in the European theater."&lt;ref name=Cole1964/&gt;{{rp|170}}

===Battle for St. Vith===
{{Main|Battle of St. Vith}}
In the center, the town of St. Vith, a vital road junction, presented the main challenge for both von Manteuffel's and Dietrich's forces. The defenders, led by the [[7th Armored Division (United States)|7th Armored Division]], included the remaining regiment of the 106th U.S. Infantry Division, with elements of the [[9th Armored Division (United States)|9th Armored Division]] and 28th U.S. Infantry Division. These units, which operated under the command of Generals Robert W. Hasbrouck (7th Armored) and [[Alan W. Jones]] (106th Infantry), successfully resisted the German attacks, significantly slowing the German advance. At Montgomery's orders, St. Vith was evacuated on 21 December; U.S. troops fell back to entrenched positions in the area, presenting an imposing obstacle to a successful German advance. By 23 December, as the Germans shattered their flanks, the defenders' position became untenable and U.S. troops were ordered to retreat west of the [[Salm River]]. Since the German plan called for the capture of St. Vith by 18:00 on 17 December, the prolonged action in and around it dealt a major setback to their timetable.&lt;ref name=Cole1964/&gt;{{rp|407}}

===Meuse River bridges===
[[File:British Sherman Firefly Namur.jpg|thumb|British [[Sherman Firefly|Sherman "Firefly"]] tank in Namur on the Meuse River, December 1944]]

To protect the river crossings on the Meuse at Givet, Dinant and Namur, Montgomery ordered those few units available to hold the bridges on 19 December. This led to a hastily assembled force including rear-echelon troops, military police and [[United States Army Air Force|Army Air Force]] personnel. The [[29th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|British 29th Armoured Brigade]] of [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 11th Armoured Division]], which had turned in its tanks for re-equipping, was told to take back their tanks and head to the area. [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|British XXX Corps]] was significantly reinforced for this effort. Units of the corps which fought in the Ardennes were the [[51st (Highland) Division|51st (Highland)]] and [[53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division|53rd (Welsh) Infantry]] Divisions, the [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 6th Airborne Division]], the 29th and [[33rd Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|33rd Armoured Brigades]], and the [[34th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|34th Tank Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.battleofthebulgememories.be/fr/stories/armeebritanique/203-the-british-in-the-battle-of-the-ardennes.html |title=The British in the Battle of the Ardennes |first=Guy |last=Blockmans |date=6 May 2002 |accessdate=10 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823183012/http://www.battleofthebulgememories.be/fr/stories/armeebritanique/203-the-british-in-the-battle-of-the-ardennes.html |archive-date=23 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the German forces on the northern and southern shoulders who were experiencing great difficulties, the German advance in the center gained considerable ground. The Fifth Panzer Army was spearheaded by the 2nd Panzer Division while the Panzer Lehr Division (Armored Training Division) came up from the south, leaving Bastogne to other units. The [[Ourthe River]] was passed at Ourtheville on 21 December. Lack of fuel held up the advance for one day, but on 23 December the offensive was resumed towards the two small towns of [[Hargimont]] and [[Marche-en-Famenne]]. Hargimont was captured the same day, but Marche-en-Famenne was strongly defended by the American [[84th Division (United States)|84th Division]]. Gen. [[Heinrich Freiherr von Lüttwitz|von Lüttwitz]], commander of the [[XLVII Panzer Corps (Germany)|XXXXVII Panzer-Korps]], ordered the Division to turn westwards towards Dinant and the Meuse, leaving only a blocking force at Marche-en-Famenne. Although advancing only in a narrow corridor, 2nd Panzer Division was still making rapid headway, leading to jubilation in Berlin. Headquarters now freed up the [[9th Panzer Division]] for Fifth Panzer Army, which was deployed at Marche.{{sfn|Zaloga|2004|pp=76–83}}

On 22/23 December German forces reached the woods of [[Foy-Nôtre-Dame]], only a few kilometers ahead of Dinant. The narrow corridor caused considerable difficulties, as constant flanking attacks threatened the division. On 24 December, German forces made their furthest penetration west. The Panzer Lehr Division took the town of [[Celles, Houyet|Celles]], while a bit farther north, parts of 2nd Panzer Division were in sight of the Meuse near Dinant at Foy-Nôtre-Dame. A hastily assembled British blocking force on the east side of the river prevented the German Battlegroup Böhm from approaching the Dinant bridge. The [[29th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|29th Armoured Brigade]] ambushed the Germans knocking out three Panthers and a number of vehicles in and around Foy Notre Dame.{{sfn|Cole|1994|p=568}} By late Christmas Eve the advance in this sector was stopped, as Allied forces threatened the narrow corridor held by the 2nd Panzer Division.{{sfn|Zaloga|2004|pp=76–83}}

===Operation Greif and Operation Währung===
{{Main|Operation Greif}}
{{Wikisource|The Ardennes: Battle of the Bulge/Chapter XI|The 1st SS Panzer Division's Dash Westward, and Operation Greif}}

For Operation Greif ("[[Griffin]]"), Otto Skorzeny successfully infiltrated a small part of his battalion of English-speaking Germans disguised in American uniforms behind the Allied lines. Although they failed to take the vital bridges over the Meuse, their presence caused confusion out of all proportion to their military activities, and rumors spread quickly.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1092}} Even General George Patton was alarmed and, on 17 December, described the situation to General Dwight Eisenhower as "Krauts&amp;nbsp;... speaking perfect English&amp;nbsp;... raising hell, cutting wires, turning road signs around, spooking whole divisions, and shoving a bulge into our defenses."

Checkpoints were set up all over the Allied rear, greatly slowing the movement of soldiers and equipment. [[Military Police Corps (United States)|American MPs]] at these checkpoints grilled troops on things that every American was expected to know, like the identity of [[Mickey Mouse]]'s girlfriend, baseball scores, or the capital of a particular U.S. state—though many could not remember or did not know. General Omar Bradley was briefly detained when he correctly identified [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] as the capital of [[Illinois]] because the American MP who questioned him mistakenly believed the capital was Chicago.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1092}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Decisive Battles: From Yorktown to Operation Desert Storm |author=Jonathon Riley |date=11 August 2010 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tightened security nonetheless made things very hard for the German infiltrators, and a number of them were captured. Even during interrogation, they continued their goal of spreading [[disinformation]]; when asked about their mission, some of them claimed they had been told to go to Paris to either kill or capture General Dwight Eisenhower.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1090}} Security around the general was greatly increased, and Eisenhower was confined to his headquarters. Because Skorzeny's men were captured in American uniforms, they were executed as spies.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1092}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Men of Steel: I SS Panzer Corps: The Ardennes and Eastern Front, 1944–45 |author=Michael Reynolds |date=1 February 2006 |page=58 |publisher=[[Casemate Publishers]] |isbn=1-932033-51-3 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 July 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This was the standard practice of every army at the time, as many belligerents considered it necessary to protect their territory against the grave dangers of enemy spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Substantive and Procedural Aspects of International Criminal Law: The Experience of International and National Courts |editor=Gabrielle McDonald |date= 1 May 2000 |page=1951 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]] |isbn=90-411-1135-2 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 July 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Skorzeny said that he was told by German legal experts that as long he did not order his men to fight in combat while wearing American uniforms, such a tactic was a legitimate [[ruse of war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War |url=https://archive.org/details/lawarmedconflict00soli |url-access=limited |author=Gary D.

He later moved to Spain and South America.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=1092}}

Operation Währung was carried out by a small number of German agents who infiltrated Allied lines in American uniforms. These agents were tasked with using an existing Nazi intelligence network to bribe rail and port workers to disrupt Allied supply operations.

==Attack in the south==
[[File:Battle of the Bulge 7th.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Erich Brandenberger]] led Seventh Army in the southernmost attack route.]]

Further south on Manteuffel's front, the main thrust was delivered by all attacking divisions crossing the [[River Our]], then increasing the pressure on the key road centers of St. Vith and Bastogne. The more experienced U.S. 28th Infantry Division put up a much more dogged defense than the inexperienced soldiers of the 106th Infantry Division. The [[112th Infantry Regiment (United States)|112th Infantry Regiment]] (the most northerly of the 28th Division's regiments), holding a continuous front east of the Our, kept German troops from seizing and using the Our River bridges around [[Ouren]] for two days, before withdrawing progressively westwards.

[[File:DeadBelgiumcivilians1944.jpg|thumb|left|Belgian civilians killed by German units during the offensive]]

The 109th and 110th Regiments of the 28th Division fared worse, as they were spread so thinly that their positions were easily bypassed. Both offered stubborn resistance in the face of superior forces and threw the German schedule off by several days. The 110th's situation was by far the worst, as it was responsible for an {{convert|11|mi|adj=on|order=flip|sp=us}} front while its 2nd Battalion was withheld as the divisional reserve. Panzer columns took the outlying villages and widely separated strong points in bitter fighting, and advanced to points near Bastogne within four days. The struggle for the villages and American strong points, plus transport confusion on the German side, slowed the attack sufficiently to allow the [[101st Airborne Division]] (reinforced by elements from the [[9th Armored Division (United States)|9th]] and [[10th Armored Division (United States)|10th Armored Divisions]]) to reach Bastogne by truck on the morning of 19 December. The fierce defense of Bastogne, in which American paratroopers particularly distinguished themselves, made it impossible for the Germans to take the town with its important road junctions. The panzer columns swung past on either side, cutting off Bastogne on 20 December but failing to secure the vital crossroads.

In the extreme south, Brandenberger's three infantry divisions were checked by divisions of the [[U.S. VIII Corps]] after an advance of {{convert|4|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}}; that front was then firmly held. Only the [[5th Parachute Division (Germany)|5th Parachute Division]] of Brandenberger's command was able to thrust forward {{convert|12|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}} on the inner flank to partially fulfill its assigned role. Eisenhower and his principal commanders realized by 17 December that the fighting in the [[Ardennes]] was a major offensive and not a local counterattack, and they ordered vast reinforcements to the area. Within a week 250,000 troops had been sent. General Gavin of the [[82nd Airborne Division]] arrived on the scene first and ordered the 101st to hold Bastogne while the 82nd would take the more difficult task of facing the SS Panzer Divisions; it was also thrown into the battle north of the bulge, near Elsenborn Ridge.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Siege of Bastogne===

Senior Allied commanders met in a bunker in [[Verdun-sur-Meuse|Verdun]] on 19 December. By this time, the town of Bastogne and its network of 11 hard-topped roads leading through the widely forested mountainous terrain with deep river valleys and boggy mud of the Ardennes region was under severe threat. Bastogne had previously been the site of the [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII Corps]] headquarters. Two separate westbound German columns that were to have bypassed the town to the south and north, the [[2nd Panzer Division]] and [[Panzer-Lehr-Division]] of XLVII Panzer Corps, as well as the Corps' infantry ([[26th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|26th Volksgrenadier Division]]), coming due west had been engaged and much slowed and frustrated in outlying battles at defensive positions up to {{convert|10|mi|order=flip|sp=us}} from the town proper, but these defensive positions were gradually being forced back onto and into the hasty defenses built within the municipality. Moreover, the sole corridor that was open (to the southeast) was threatened and it had been sporadically closed as the front shifted, and there was expectation that it would be completely closed sooner than later, given the strong likelihood that the town would soon be surrounded.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Gen. Eisenhower, realizing that the Allies could destroy German forces much more easily when they were out in the open and on the offensive than if they were on the defensive, told his generals, "The present situation is to be regarded as one of opportunity for us and not of disaster. There will be only cheerful faces at this table." Patton, realizing what Eisenhower implied, responded, "Hell, let's have the guts to let the bastards go all the way to Paris. Then, we'll really cut 'em off and chew 'em up." Eisenhower, after saying he was not that optimistic, asked Patton how long it would take to turn his Third Army, located in northeastern France, north to counterattack. To the disbelief of the other generals present, Patton replied that he could attack with two divisions within 48 hours. Unknown to the other officers present, before he left Patton had ordered his staff to prepare three contingency plans for a northward turn in at least corps strength. By the time Eisenhower asked him how long it would take, the movement was already underway.{{sfn|Ambrose|1998|p=208}} On 20 December, Eisenhower removed the First and Ninth U.S. Armies from Gen. Bradley's [[12th Army Group]] and placed them under Montgomery's [[British 21st Army Group|21st Army Group]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1984|p=422}}

By 21 December the Germans had surrounded [[Bastogne]], which was defended by the [[101st Airborne Division]], the all African American [[969th Artillery Battalion (United States)|969th Artillery Battalion]], and Combat Command B of the [[10th Armored Division (United States)|10th Armored Division]]. Conditions inside the perimeter were tough—most of the medical supplies and medical personnel had been captured. Food was scarce, and by 22 December artillery ammunition was restricted to 10 rounds per gun per day. The weather cleared the next day and supplies (primarily ammunition) were dropped over four of the next five days.&lt;ref name="bastogne"&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/Bastogne/bast-21.htm |title=Bastogne: The First Eight Days |chapter=The Relief |last=Marshall |first=S.L.A. |date=1946 |publisher=Infantry Journal Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite determined German attacks, the perimeter held. The German commander, Generalleutnant (Lt. Gen.) [[Heinrich Freiherr von Lüttwitz]],{{sfn|Marshall|1988|p=177}} requested Bastogne's surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedropzone.org/europe/Bulge/kinnard.html |title=NUTS!

Gen. [[Anthony McAuliffe]], acting commander of the 101st, was told of the Nazi demand to surrender, in frustration he responded, "Nuts!" After turning to other pressing issues, his staff reminded him that they should reply to the German demand. One officer, Lt. Col. [[Harry Kinnard]], noted that McAuliffe's initial reply would be "tough to beat." Thus McAuliffe wrote on the paper, which was typed up and delivered to the Germans, the line he made famous and a morale booster to his troops: "NUTS!"{{sfn|Ambrose|1992|loc=c. "Bastogne"}} That reply had to be explained, both to the Germans and to non-American Allies.{{efn|[[wikt:Nuts|Nuts]] can mean several things in [[American English]] slang. In this case it signified rejection, and was explained to the Germans as meaning "Go to Hell!"}}

Both 2nd Panzer and Panzer-Lehr division moved forward from Bastogne after 21 December, leaving only Panzer-Lehr division's 901st Regiment to assist the 26th Volksgrenadier-Division in attempting to capture the crossroads. The 26th VG received one Panzergrenadier Regiment from the [[15th Panzergrenadier Division]] on Christmas Eve for its main assault the next day. Because it lacked sufficient troops and those of the 26th VG Division were near exhaustion, the XLVII Panzerkorps concentrated its assault on several individual locations on the west side of the perimeter in sequence rather than launching one simultaneous attack on all sides. The assault, despite initial success by its tanks in penetrating the American line, was defeated and all the tanks destroyed. On the following day of 26 December the spearhead of Gen. Patton's 4th Armored Division, supplemented by the 26th (Yankee) Infantry Division, broke through and opened a corridor to Bastogne.&lt;ref name="bastogne"/&gt;

==Allied counteroffensive==
[[File:Battle of the Bulge progress.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|The original objectives are outlined in red dashed lines. The orange line indicates their furthest advance.]]

On 23 December the weather conditions started improving, allowing the Allied air forces to attack. They launched devastating bombing raids on the German supply points in their rear, and [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s started attacking the German troops on the roads. Allied air forces also helped the defenders of Bastogne, dropping much-needed supplies—medicine, food, blankets, and ammunition. A team of volunteer surgeons flew in by [[military glider]] and began operating in a tool room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-pathfinders-resupply-101st-airborne-division-troops-in-bastogne-via-daring-parachute-drop.htm |title=World War II: Pathfinders Resupply 101st Airborne Division Troops in Bastogne Via Daring Parachute Drop |work=World War II Magazine |publisher=Historynet.com |accessdate=12 July 2011 |date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 24 December the German advance was effectively stalled short of the Meuse. Units of the [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|British XXX Corps]] were holding the bridges at Dinant, Givet, and Namur and U.S. units were about to take over. The Germans had outrun their supply lines, and shortages of fuel and ammunition were becoming critical. Up to this point the German losses had been light, notably in armor, with the exception of Peiper's losses. On the evening of 24 December, General [[Hasso von Manteuffel]] recommended to Hitler's Military Adjutant a halt to all offensive operations and a withdrawal back to the Westwall (literally ''Western Rampart''). Hitler rejected this.

Disagreement and confusion at the Allied command prevented a strong response, throwing away the opportunity for a decisive action. In the center, on Christmas Eve, the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]] attempted to attack and cut off the spearheads of the 2nd Panzer Division at the Meuse, while the units from the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry Group]] kept the 9th Panzer Division at Marche busy. As result, parts of the 2nd Panzer Division were cut off. The Panzer-Lehr division tried to relieve them, but was only partially successful, as the perimeter held. For the next two days the perimeter was strengthened. On 26 and 27 December the trapped units of 2nd Panzer Division made two break-out attempts, again only with partial success, as major quantities of equipment fell into Allied hands. Further Allied pressure out of Marche finally led the German command to the conclusion that no further offensive action towards the Meuse was possible.{{sfn|Zaloga|2004|pp=84–86}}

In the south, Patton's Third Army was battling to relieve Bastogne. At 16:50 on 26 December, the lead element, [[U.S. 37th Armor Regiment|Company D, 37th Tank Battalion]] of the [[U.S. 4th Armored Division|4th Armored Division]], reached Bastogne, ending the siege.

{{Main|Operation Bodenplatte|Operation Nordwind}}
[[File:Y-34 Metz Airfield - Destroyed P-47s Operation Bodenplatte.jpg|thumb|P-47s destroyed at Y-34 Metz-Frescaty airfield during Operation Bodenplatte]]

On 1 January, in an attempt to keep the offensive going, the Germans launched two new operations. At 09:15, the Luftwaffe launched [[Unternehmen Bodenplatte]] (Operation Baseplate), a major campaign against Allied airfields in the [[Low Countries]]. Hundreds of planes attacked Allied airfields, destroying or severely damaging some 465 aircraft. The Luftwaffe lost 277 planes, 62 to Allied fighters and 172 mostly because of an unexpectedly high number of Allied [[flak]] guns, set up to protect against German [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] [[flying bomb]]/missile attacks and using [[proximity fuse]]d shells, but also by [[friendly fire]] from the German flak guns that were uninformed of the pending large-scale German air operation. The Germans suffered heavy losses at an airfield named [[Zutendaal Air Base|Y-29]], losing 40 of their own planes while damaging only four American planes. While the Allies recovered from their losses within days, the operation left the Luftwaffe ineffective for the remainder of the war.{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=769}}

On the same day, German [[Army Group G]] (''Heeresgruppe G'') and [[Army Group Oberrhein (Germany)|Army Group Upper Rhine]] (''Heeresgruppe Oberrhein'') launched a major offensive against the thinly-stretched, {{convert|70|mi|km|order=flip|sp=us}} line of the Seventh U.S. Army. This offensive, known as Unternehmen Nordwind ([[Operation Nordwind|Operation North Wind]]), was the last major German offensive of the war on the Western Front. The weakened Seventh Army had, at Eisenhower's orders, sent troops, equipment, and supplies north to reinforce the American armies in the Ardennes, and the offensive left it in dire straits.

By 15 January Seventh Army's [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] was fighting on three sides in [[Alsace]]. With casualties mounting, and running short on replacements, tanks, ammunition, and supplies, Seventh Army was forced to withdraw to defensive positions on the south bank of the Moder River on 21 January. The German offensive drew to a close on 25 January. In the bitter, desperate fighting of Operation Nordwind, VI Corps, which had borne the brunt of the fighting, suffered a total of 14,716 casualties. The total for Seventh Army for January was 11,609.{{sfn|Cirillo|2003|p=53}} Total casualties included at least 9,000 wounded.{{sfn|Clarke|Smith|1993|p=527}} First, Third, and Seventh Armies suffered a total of 17,000 hospitalized from the cold.{{sfn|Cirillo|2003|p=53}}{{efn|A footnote to the U.S. Army's official history volume "Riviera to the Rhine" makes the following note on U.S. Seventh Army casualties: "As elsewhere, casualty figures are only rough estimates, and the figures presented are based on the postwar 'Seventh Army Operational Report, Alsace Campaign and Battle Participation, 1 June 1945' (copy CMH), which notes 11,609 Seventh Army battle casualties for the period, plus 2,836 cases of trench foot and 380 cases of frostbite, and estimates about 17,000 Germans killed or wounded with 5,985 processed prisoners of war. But the VI Corps AAR for January 1945 puts its total losses at 14,716 (773 killed, 4,838 wounded, 3,657 missing, and 5,448 nonbattle casualties); and Albert E. Cowdrey and Graham A. Cosmas, ''The Medical Department: The War Against Germany'', draft CMH MS (1988), pp. 54–55, a forthcoming volume in the United States Army in World War II series, reports Seventh Army hospitals processing about 9,000 wounded and 17,000 'sick and injured' during the period. Many of these may have been returned to their units, and others may have come from American units operating in the Colmar area but still supported by Seventh Army medical services."}}

[[File:p41(map).jpg|thumb|Erasing the Bulge—The Allied counterattack, 26 December – 25 January]]

While the German offensive had ground to a halt during January 1945, they still controlled a dangerous salient in the Allied line. Patton's Third Army in the south, centered around Bastogne, would attack north, Montgomery's forces in the north would strike south, and the two forces planned to meet at [[Houffalize]].

The temperature during that January was extremely low, which required weapons to be maintained and truck engines run every half-hour to prevent their oil from congealing. The offensive went forward regardless.

Eisenhower wanted Montgomery to go on the counter offensive on 1 January, with the aim of meeting up with Patton's advancing Third Army and cutting off most of the attacking Germans, trapping them in a pocket. Montgomery, refusing to risk underprepared infantry in a snowstorm for a strategically unimportant area, did not launch the attack until 3 January, by which time substantial numbers of German troops had already managed to fall back successfully, but at the cost of losing most of their heavy equipment.

At the start of the offensive, the First and Third U.S. Armies were separated by about {{convert|25|mi|abbr=on|order=flip}}. American progress in the south was also restricted to about a kilometre or a little over half a mile per day. On 2 January, the Tiger IIs of German Heavy Tank Battalion 506 supported an attack by the 12th SS Hitlerjugend division against U.S. positions near Wardin and knocked out 15 Sherman tanks.{{sfn|Schneider|2004|p=274}} The majority of the German force executed a successful fighting withdrawal and escaped the battle area, although the fuel situation had become so dire that most of the German armor had to be abandoned.

On 7 January 1945 [[Hitler]] agreed to withdraw all forces from the Ardennes, including the SS-Panzer divisions, thus ending all offensive operations. On January 14, Hitler granted [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] permission to carry out a fairly drastic retreat in the Ardennes region. [[Houffalize]] and the Bastogne front would be abandoned.&lt;ref name="bergstrom"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bergström |first=Christer |date=2014 |title=The Ardennes, 1944–1945 |url= |location= |publisher=Casemate Publishers |page=379 |isbn=978-1-61200-277-4 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable fighting went on for another 3 weeks; St. Vith was recaptured by the Americans on 23 January, and the last German units participating in the offensive did not return to their start line until 25 January.

[[Winston Churchill]], addressing the House of Commons following the Battle of the Bulge said, "This is undoubtedly the greatest American battle of the war and will, I believe, be regarded as an ever-famous American victory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/botb/overview.html |title=Overview – Battle of the Bulge |publisher=United States Army |date=16 December 1944 |accessdate=16 June 2013 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507014043/http://www.army.mil/botb/overview.html |archivedate=7 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy and leadership==

===Hitler's chosen few===
The plan and timing for the Ardennes attack sprang from the mind of Adolf Hitler. He believed a critical fault line existed between the British and American military commands, and that a heavy blow on the Western Front would shatter this alliance. Planning for the "Watch on the Rhine" offensive emphasized secrecy and the commitment of overwhelming force. Due to the use of landline communications within Germany, motorized runners carrying orders, and draconian threats from Hitler, the timing and mass of the attack was not detected by [[Ultra]] codebreakers and achieved complete surprise.{{sfn|MacDonald|1985|pp=77–79}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J28477, Ardennenoffensive, Lagebesprechnung.jpg|thumb|German field commanders plan the advance]]

After officers of the regular German Army attempted to assassinate him, Hitler had increasingly trusted only the Nazi Party SS and its armed branch, the Waffen-SS. He entrusted them with carrying out his decisive counterattack.{{sfn|MacDonald|1985|pp=21–22}} But following the Allied Normandy invasion, the SS armored units had suffered significant leadership casualties. This included SS-''Gruppenführer'' (Major General) [[Kurt Meyer]], commander of the 12th SS Panzer (Armor) Division, captured by Belgian partisans on 6 September 1944.&lt;ref name="mitcham"&gt;{{cite book|title=Panzers in Winter, Hitler's Army and the Battle of the Bulge|last=Mitcham|first=Samuel W.| authorlink = Samuel W.

The leadership composition of the Sixth Panzer Division had a distinctly political nature.{{sfn|Cole|1964|pp=1–64}}

Despite their loyalty, none of the German field commanders entrusted with planning and executing the offensive believed it was possible to capture Antwerp. Even Dietrich believed the Ardennes was a poor area for armored warfare and that the inexperienced and badly equipped ''Volksgrenadier'' soldiers would clog the roads the tanks needed for their rapid advance. In fact, their horse-drawn artillery and rocket units became a significant obstacle to the armored units.&lt;ref name="astor"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Blood Dimmed Tide, The Battle of the Bulge by the Men Who Fought It|last=Astor|first=Gerald|year=1992|publisher=Donald I. Fine, Inc.|isbn=1-55611-281-5|url=https://archive.org/details/blooddimmedtideb00gera}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|113}} Other than making futile objections to Hitler in private, Dietrich generally stayed out of planning the offensive. Model and Manteuffel, technical experts from the eastern front, told Hitler that a limited offensive with the goal of surrounding and crushing the American 1st Army would be the best goal their offensive could hope to achieve. Their ideas shared the same fate as Dietrich's objections.&lt;ref name="eisenhower"/&gt;

The German staff planning and organization of the attack was well done. Most of the units committed to the offensive reached their jump off points undetected. They were for the most part well organized and supplied for the attack, although they were counting on capturing American gasoline dumps to fuel their vehicles. As the battle ensued, on the northern shoulder of the offensive, Dietrich stopped the armored assault on the twin villages after two days and changed the axis of their advance southward through the hamlet of Domäne Bütgenbach. The headlong drive on Elsenborn Ridge lacked needed support from German units that had already bypassed the ridge.&lt;ref name="eisenhower"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisenhower|first=John S.D.|title=The Bitter Woods|url=https://archive.org/details/bitterwoodsdra00eise|url-access=registration|edition=First|publisher=G.P.

===Allied high-command controversy===
[[File:Bernard Law Montgomery.jpg|thumb|upright|Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]]]]
[[File:Dwight D. Eisenhower as General of the Army crop.jpg|thumb|upright|General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force|Supreme Allied Commander]]]]

One of the fault lines between the British and American high commands was General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s commitment to a broad front advance. This view was opposed by the British Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal [[Alan Brooke]], as well as Field Marshal Montgomery, who promoted a rapid advance on a narrow front, with the other allied armies in reserve.&lt;ref name="eisenhower"/&gt;{{rp|91}}

===Montgomery's actions===
British Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] differed from the U.S. command in how to respond to the German attack and his public statements to that effect caused tension in the American high command. Major-General [[Freddie de Guingand]], Chief of Staff of Montgomery's 21st Army Group, rose to the occasion, and personally smoothed over the disagreements on 30 December.&lt;ref name="larrabee"&gt;{{cite book|title=Commander in Chief, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, His Lieutenants, and Their War|last=Larrabee|first=Eric|year=1987|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster Inc.|isbn=0-671-66382-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|489–90}}

As the Ardennes crisis developed, the U.S. First Army ([[Courtney Hodges|Hodges]]) and U.S. Ninth Army ([[William Hood Simpson|Simpson]]) on the northern shoulder of the German penetration lost communications with adjacent armies, as well as with Bradley's headquarters in Luxembourg City to the south of the "bulge".{{sfn|Urban|2005|p=194}} Consequently, at 10:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 20 December, Eisenhower transferred the command of the U.S. First and Ninth Armies temporarily from Bradley to Montgomery.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Memoirs of Field Marshal Montgomery'' (1958) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; Command of the U.S. First Army reverted to the U.S. 12th Army Group on 17 January 1945,&lt;ref&gt;The Supreme Command, Forrest C Pogue, Chapter XX - The Winter Counteroffensives, pages 378 &amp; 395&lt;/ref&gt; and command of the U.S. Ninth Army reverted to the U.S. 12th Army Group on 4 April 1945.

Montgomery wrote about the situation he found on 20 December:

{{quote|The First Army was fighting desperately. Having given orders to [[Miles Dempsey|Dempsey]] and [[Harry Crerar|Crerar]], who arrived for a conference at 11&amp;nbsp;am, I left at noon for the H.Q. of the First Army, where I had instructed Simpson to meet me. I found the northern flank of the bulge was very disorganized. Ninth Army had two corps and three divisions; First Army had three corps and fifteen divisions. Neither Army Commander had seen Bradley or any senior member of his staff since the battle began, and they had no directive on which to work. The first thing to do was to see the battle on the northern flank ''as one whole'', to ensure the vital areas were held securely, and to create reserves for counter-attack. I embarked on these measures: I put British troops under command of the Ninth Army to fight alongside American soldiers, and made that Army take over some of the First Army Front. I positioned British troops as reserves behind the First and Ninth Armies until such time as American reserves could be created. Slowly but surely the situation was held, and then finally restored. Similar action was taken on the southern flank of the bulge by Bradley, with the Third Army.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}

Due to the news blackout imposed on the 16th, the change of leadership to Montgomery did not become public information until SHAEF announced that the change in command had "absolutely nothing to do with failure on the part of the three American generals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Charles |last1=Whiting |page= 312|title= Battle Of Hurtgen Forest | publisher =Da Capo Press |date=9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|198}} The announcement resulted in headlines in British newspapers and ''Stars and Stripes'', which for the first time mentioned British contributions to the fighting.

Montgomery requested permission from Churchill to give a press conference to explain the situation. Though some of his staff were concerned at how the press conference would affect Montgomery's image, it was cleared by [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]] Alan Brooke, who was possibly the only person from whom Montgomery would accept advice.

On the same day as Hitler's withdrawal order of 7 January, Montgomery held his press conference at Zonhoven.{{sfn|Gallagher|1945}} Montgomery started with giving credit to the "courage and good fighting quality" of the American troops, characterizing a typical American as a "very brave fighting man who has that tenacity in battle which makes a great soldier", and went on to talk about the necessity of Allied teamwork, and praised Eisenhower, stating, "Teamwork wins battles and battle victories win wars. On our team, the captain is General Ike."

Then Montgomery described the course of the battle for a half-hour. Coming to the end of his speech he said he had "employed the whole available power of the British Group of Armies; this power was brought into play very gradually&amp;nbsp;... Finally it was put into battle with a bang&amp;nbsp;... you thus have the picture of British troops fighting on both sides of the Americans who have suffered a hard blow." He stated that he (i.e., the German) was "headed off&amp;nbsp;... seen off&amp;nbsp;... and&amp;nbsp;... written off... The battle has been the most interesting, I think possibly one of the most interesting and tricky battles I have ever handled."{{sfn|Bradley|1951|p=58}}{{sfn|Ryan|1995|pp=204–205}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''The Memoirs of Field Marshal Montgomery'' (1958), p. 311–314&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his positive remarks about American soldiers, the overall impression given by Montgomery, at least in the ears of the American military leadership, was that he had taken the lion's share of credit for the success of the campaign, and had been responsible for rescuing the besieged Americans.&lt;ref name=thisday&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/monty-holds-a-press-conference |title=This Day in History: Monty holds a press conference |publisher=History.com |accessdate=21 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705054757/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/monty-holds-a-press-conference |archive-date=5 July 2014 |url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His comments were interpreted as self-promoting, particularly his claim that when the situation "began to deteriorate," Eisenhower had placed him in command in the north. Patton and Eisenhower both felt this was a misrepresentation of the relative share of the fighting played by the British and Americans in the Ardennes (for every British soldier there were thirty to forty Americans in the fight), and that it belittled the part played by Bradley, Patton and other American commanders. In the context of Patton's and Montgomery's well-known antipathy, Montgomery's failure to mention the contribution of any American general besides Eisenhower was seen as insulting. Indeed, General Bradley and his American commanders were already starting their counterattack by the time Montgomery was given command of 1st and 9th U.S. Armies.{{sfn|Bradley|1983|pp=382–385}} Focusing exclusively on his own generalship, Montgomery continued to say he thought the counteroffensive had gone very well but did not explain the reason for his delayed attack on 3 January. He later attributed this to needing more time for preparation on the northern front. According to Winston Churchill, the attack from the south under Patton was steady but slow and involved heavy losses, and Montgomery was trying to avoid this situation.

Many American officers had already grown to dislike Montgomery, who was seen by them as an overly cautious commander, arrogant, and all too willing to say uncharitable things about the Americans. The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill found it necessary in a speech to Parliament to explicitly state that the Battle of the Bulge was purely an American victory.

Montgomery subsequently recognized his error and later wrote: "Not only was it probably a mistake to have held this conference at all in the sensitive state of feeling at the time, but what I said was skilfully distorted by the enemy. [[Chester Wilmot]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Struggle for Europe'', p. 611&lt;/ref&gt; explained that his dispatch to the [[BBC]] about it was intercepted by the German wireless, re-written to give it an anti-American bias, and then broadcast by Arnhem Radio, which was then in [[Goebbels]]' hands. Monitored at [[Omar Bradley|Bradley]]'s HQ, this broadcast was mistaken for a BBC transmission and it was this twisted text that started the uproar."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Montgomery later said, "Distorted or not, I think now that I should never have held that press conference. So great were the feelings against me on the part of the American generals that whatever I said was bound to be wrong. I should therefore have said nothing." Eisenhower commented in his own memoirs: "I doubt if Montgomery ever came to realize how resentful some American commanders were. They believed he had belittled them—and they were not slow to voice reciprocal scorn and contempt."&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, Brian. ''A Field Marshal in the Family'', Pen and Sword, 2010, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradley and Patton both threatened to resign unless Montgomery's command was changed. Eisenhower, encouraged by his British deputy [[Arthur Tedder]], had decided to sack Montgomery. Intervention by Montgomery's and Eisenhower's [[Chief of Staff|Chiefs of Staff]], Maj. Gen. [[Freddie de Guingand]], and Lt. Gen. [[Walter Bedell Smith]], moved Eisenhower to reconsider and allowed Montgomery to apologize.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Speaking subsequently to a British writer while himself a prisoner in Britain, the former German commander of the [[5th Panzer Army]], [[Hasso von Manteuffel]] said of Montgomery's leadership:

{{quote|The operations of the American 1st Army had developed into a series of individual holding actions. Montgomery's contribution to restoring the situation was that he turned a series of isolated actions into a coherent battle fought according to a clear and definite plan. It was his refusal to engage in premature and piecemeal counter-attacks which enabled the Americans to gather their reserves and frustrate the German attempts to extend their breakthrough.{{sfn|Delaforce|2004|p=318}}}}

However, Ambrose, writing in 1997, maintained that "Putting Monty in command of the northern flank had no effect on the battle".{{sfn|Caddick-Adams|2015|p=644}}

==Casualties==

Casualty estimates for the battle vary widely. According to the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]], American forces suffered 89,500 casualties including 19,000 killed, 47,500 wounded and 23,000 missing.{{sfn|Miles|2004}} An official report by the [[United States Department of the Army]] lists 105,102 casualties, including 19,246 killed, 62,489 wounded, and 26,612 captured or missing, though this incorporates losses suffered during the German offensive in Alsace, [[Operation Nordwind|Operation "Nordwind."]]&lt;ref name="cgsc.cdmhost.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cgsc.cdmhost.com/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/p4013coll8&amp;CISOPTR=130&amp;REC=2 |publisher=Combined Arms Research Library, Department of the Army |title=Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths in World War II |accessdate=12 June 2012 |date=25 June 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|92}} A preliminary Army report restricted to the First and Third U.S. Armies listed 75,000 casualties (8,400 killed, 46,000 wounded and 21,000 missing).&lt;ref name=Pogue1954/&gt; The Battle of the Bulge was the bloodiest battle for U.S. forces in World War II.

The US 2nd Armored Division put on perhaps the best performance for the Allies, achieving a Combat Efficiency Value of 1.48 when it smashed the 2nd Panzer Division (0.52) at Celles in late December.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Result==
Although the Germans managed to begin their offensive with complete surprise and enjoyed some initial successes, they were not able to seize the initiative on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]. While the German command did not reach its goals, the Ardennes operation inflicted heavy losses and set back the Allied invasion of Germany by several weeks. The High Command of the Allied forces had planned to resume the offensive by early January 1945, after the wet season rains and severe frosts, but those plans had to be postponed until 29 January 1945 in connection with the unexpected changes in the front.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The Allies pressed their advantage following the battle. By the beginning of February 1945, the lines were roughly where they had been in December 1944. In early February, the Allies launched an attack all along the Western front: in the north under Montgomery toward Aachen; in the center, under [[Courtney Hodges]]; and in the south, under Patton.

The German losses in the battle were especially critical: their last reserves were now gone, the [[Luftwaffe]] had been shattered, and remaining forces throughout the West were being pushed back to defend the [[Siegfried Line]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In response to the early success of the offensive, on 6 January Churchill contacted Stalin to request that the Soviets put pressure on the Germans on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Sandler|2002|p=101}} On 12 January, the Soviets began the massive [[Vistula–Oder Offensive]], originally planned for 20 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=de Senarclens |first=Pierre |year=1988 |title=Yalta |publisher=Transaction |isbn=0-88738-152-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39}} It had been brought forward from 20 January to 12 January because meteorological reports warned of a thaw later in the month, and the tanks needed hard ground for the offensive (and the advance of the Red Army was assisted by two Panzer Armies ([[5th Panzer Army|5th]] and [[6th Panzer Army|6th]]) being redeployed for the Ardennes attack).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beevor |first=Antony |authorlink=Antony Beevor |title=Ardennes 1944: Hitler's last gamble |publisher=Viking |date=2015 |location=New York |pages=331 |url= |doi= |isbn=978-0-670-02531-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill was elated at Stalin's offer of help,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov : A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; thanking Stalin for the thrilling news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Second World War Volume 6 "Triumph and Tragedy"|last=Churchil|first=Winston|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, most U.S. black soldiers still served only in maintenance or service positions, or in segregated units. Because of troop shortages during the Battle of the Bulge, Eisenhower decided to integrate the service for the first time.&lt;ref name=Blumenson1972&gt;{{cite book |last=Blumenson |first=Martin |title=Eisenhower |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York |year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}} This was an important step toward a desegregated United States military.

The Germans officially referred to the offensive as Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein ("Operation [[Die Wacht am Rhein|Watch on the Rhine]]"), while the Allies designated it the Ardennes Counteroffensive. The phrase "Battle of the Bulge" was coined by contemporary press to describe the [[Salient (military)|bulge]] in German front lines on wartime news maps,{{sfn|Cirillo|2003|p=4}}{{efn|{{harvnb|Eggenberger|1985}} cites the official name as Ardennes-Alsace campaign; David Eggenberger describes this battle as the "Second Battle of the Ardennes".}}{{sfn|Stanton|2006|}} and it became the most widely used name for the battle. The offensive was planned by the German forces with utmost secrecy, with minimal radio traffic and movements of troops and equipment under cover of darkness.

The battle around [[Bastogne]] received a great deal of media attention because in early December 1944 it was a rest and recreation area for many [[war correspondent]]s. The rapid advance by the German forces who surrounded the town, the spectacular resupply operations via parachute and glider, along with the fast action of General Patton's Third U.S. Army, all were featured in newspaper articles and on radio and captured the public's imagination; there were no correspondents in the area of [[Battle of St. Vith|Saint-Vith]], [[Battle of Elsenborn Ridge|Elsenborn]], or Monschau-Höfen.&lt;ref name=nyssen&gt;{{cite web|first=Léon |last=Nyssen |title=The Battle of Elsenborn December 1944 (Part V)|
