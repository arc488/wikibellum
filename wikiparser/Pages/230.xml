'''Operation Nordwind''' ({{lang-de|Unternehmen Nordwind}}) was the last major [[Nazi Germany|German]] offensive of [[World War II]] on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]. It began on 31 December 1944 in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] in southwestern Germany and northeastern France, and ended on 25 January 1945.

== Objectives ==
In a briefing at his military command complex at [[Adlerhorst]], [[Adolf Hitler]] declared in his speech to his division commanders on 28 December 1944 (three days prior to the launch of Operation ''Nordwind''): "This attack has a very clear objective, namely the destruction of the enemy forces. There is not a matter of prestige involved here. It is a matter of destroying and exterminating the enemy forces wherever we find them."&lt;ref name="Riviera"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=Jeffrey J.|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Ross|title=Riviera to the Rhine (CMH Pub 7–10)|date=1993|publisher=Center of Military History, United States Army|location=Washington, DC|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/007/7-10-1/CMH_Pub_7-10-1.pdf|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|499}}

The goal of the offensive was to break through the lines of the [[Seventh United States Army|U.S. Seventh Army]] and [[First Army (France)|French 1st Army]] in the Upper [[Vosges]] mountains and the Alsatian Plain, and destroy them, as well as the seizure of Strasbourg, which Himmler had promised would be captured by 30 January. This would leave the way open for [[Operation Zahnarzt|Operation Dentist]] (''Unternehmen Zahnarzt''), a planned major thrust into the rear of the [[Third United States Army|U.S. Third Army]] which would lead to the destruction of that army.&lt;ref name="Riviera"/&gt;{{rp|494}}

== Offensive ==
{{see also|Operation Nordwind order of battle}}
On 31 December 1944, German [[Army Group G]]—commanded by Generaloberst [[Johannes Blaskowitz]]—and [[Army Group Oberrhein (Germany)|Army Group Oberrhein]] ("Upper Rhein")—commanded by Reichsführer-SS [[Heinrich Himmler]]—launched a major offensive against the thinly stretched, {{convert|110|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} front line held by the U.S. 7th Army. Operation Nordwind soon had the understrength U.S. 7th Army in dire straits. The 7th Army—at the orders of U.S. General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]—had sent troops, equipment, and supplies north to reinforce the American armies in the [[Ardennes]] involved in the [[Battle of the Bulge]].

On the same day that the German Army launched Operation Nordwind, the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (German Air Force) committed almost 1,000 aircraft in support. This attempt to cripple the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air forces based in northwestern [[Europe]] was known as [[Operation Bodenplatte]], which failed without having achieved any of its key objectives.

The initial Nordwind attack was conducted by three corps of the [[1st Army (Wehrmacht)|German 1st Army]] of Army Group G, and by 9 January, the XXXIX Panzer Corps was heavily engaged as well. By 15 January at least 17 German divisions (including units in the [[Colmar Pocket]]) from Army Group G and Army Group Oberrhein, including the [[6th SS Mountain Division Nord|6th SS Mountain]], [[17th SS Panzergrenadier Division Götz von Berlichingen|17th SS Panzergrenadier]], [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer]], and [[25th Panzergrenadier Division (Germany)|25th Panzergrenadier]] Divisions were engaged in the fighting. Another smaller attack was made against the French positions south of [[Strasbourg]], but it was finally stopped. The [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. VI Corps]]—which bore the brunt of the German attacks—was fighting on three sides by 15 January.

The 125th Regiment of the 21st Panzer Division under Colonel [[Hans von Luck]] aimed to sever the American supply line to [[Strasbourg]], by cutting across the eastern foothills of the [[Vosges]] at the northwest base of a natural salient in a bend of the [[River Rhine]]. Here the [[Maginot Line]] ran east–west, and now "showed what a superb fortification it was". On January 7 Luck approached the line south of Wissembourg at the villages of Rittershoffen and Hatten. Heavy American fire came from the 79th Infantry Division, the 14th Armoured Division, plus elements of the 42nd Infantry Division. On January 10 Luck reached the villages. Two weeks of heavy fighting followed. Germans and Americans each occupying parts of the villages while civilians sheltered in cellars. Luck later said that the fighting around Rittershoffen had been "one of the hardest and most costly battles that ever raged".{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=386}}

Eisenhower, fearing the outright destruction of the U.S. 7th Army, had rushed already battered divisions hurriedly relieved from the Ardennes, southeast over {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, to reinforce the 7th Army. But their arrival was delayed, and on 21 January with supplies and ammunition short, Seventh Army ordered the much-depleted 79th and 14th Divisions to retreat from Rittershoffen and fall back on new positions on the south bank of the [[Moder River]].

On 25 January the German offensive was halted, after the US [[222nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|222nd Infantry Regiment]] stopped their advance near [[Haguenau]], and earning the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] in the process. This was the same day that the reinforcements began to arrive from the Ardennes. Strasbourg was saved but the [[Colmar Pocket]] was a danger which had to be eliminated.

The German offensive was a failure, failing to destroy the Allied forces.
