'''Operation Kremlin''' (''Fall Kreml'' in [[German language|German]]) was a successful [[Germany|German]] [[deception]] operation against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces in May to June 1942.

After German troops captured the city of [[Kharkov]] in October 1941, the [[German High Command]] planned an offensive to destroy the Soviet forces toward the southern sector of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. To divert the attention of the Soviets from the thrust that would lead to the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], on May 29, 1942, the High Command ordered "the earliest possible resumption of the attack on [[Moscow]]" by [[Army Group Centre]].

The factor that made Operation Kremlin plausible to the Soviet High Command, the [[Stavka]], was
that it coincided with Soviet thinking, which the Germans had not known. The Soviets had already believed that the Germans would make a second attempt to take Moscow in a larger summer offensive in 1942. The directive given to Army Group Centre, which assigned two [[panzer]] divisions the identical missions that they had received in the previous autumn, could have been taken for the real thing, even by the German officers who were in the know. Most of them were kept in the dark about the deception, which made it all the more believable.

As part of Operation Kremlin, the [[Luftwaffe]] increased [[reconnaissance]] flights over and around Moscow, officers in charge of [[prisoner-of-war]] interrogations were given lists of questions to ask regarding Moscow's defenses and sealed packets of Moscow maps were distributed down to regimental level. A readiness date of August 1 was planned.

Although postwar Soviet accounts insisted that Operation Kremlin had failed, the Soviet High Command and the General Staff were in fact misled by the deception. [[Joseph Stalin]] and top Soviet generals had no doubt that the Germans would launch another offensive on Moscow in mid-1942. On June 28, [[Operation Blau]] began.{{fact|date=October 2016}}
