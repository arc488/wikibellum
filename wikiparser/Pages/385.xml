The '''Warsaw Uprising''' ({{lang-pl|Powstanie Warszawskie}}; {{lang-de|Warschauer Aufstand}}) was a major [[World War II]] operation, in the summer of 1944, by the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish underground resistance]], led by the Polish resistance [[Home Army]] ({{lang-pl|Armia Krajowa}}), to liberate [[Warsaw]] from German occupation. The uprising was timed to coincide with the retreat of the German forces from Poland ahead of the Soviet advance.&lt;ref name=sb/&gt; While approaching the eastern suburbs of the city, the [[Red Army]] temporarily halted combat operations, enabling the Germans to regroup and defeat the Polish resistance and to [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|destroy the city in retaliation]]. The Uprising was fought for 63 days with little outside support. It was the single largest military effort taken by any European [[Resistance during World War II|resistance movement during World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1= Eugeniusz |last1= Duraczyński |first2= Jerzy Janusz |last2= Terej|title= Europa podziemna: 1939-1945 |year= 1974 |location= Warszawa |publisher= Wiedza Powszechna |oclc= 463203458 |language= Polish |trans-title= Europe underground: 1939-1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Uprising began on 1 August 1944 as part of a nationwide [[Operation Tempest]], launched at the time of the Soviet [[Lublin–Brest Offensive]]. The main Polish objectives were to drive the Germans out of Warsaw while helping the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] defeat [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. An additional, political goal of the [[Polish Underground State]] was to liberate Poland's capital and assert Polish sovereignty before the Soviet-backed [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] could assume control.  Other immediate causes included a threat of mass German round-ups of able-bodied Poles for [[Death march#During World War II|"evacuation"]]; calls by [[Radio Moscow]]'s Polish Service for uprising; and an emotional Polish desire for justice and revenge against the enemy after five years of German occupation.{{sfn|Davies|2008|pp=268, 271}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.warsawuprising.com/doc/okulicki.pdf Warsaw Uprising 1944] ''www.warsawuprising.com'', accessed 12 September 2019&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the Poles established control over most of central Warsaw, but the Soviets ignored Polish attempts to make radio contact with them and did not advance beyond the city limits. Intense street fighting between the Germans and Poles continued. By 14 September, the eastern bank of the [[Vistula]] River opposite the Polish resistance positions was taken over by the [[First Polish Army (1944–1945)|Polish troops fighting under the Soviet command]]; 1,200 men made it across the river, but they were not reinforced by the [[Red Army]]. This, and the lack of air support from the Soviet air base five-minutes flying time away, led to allegations that [[Joseph Stalin]] tactically halted his forces to let the operation fail and allow the Polish resistance to be crushed. [[Arthur Koestler]] called the Soviet attitude "one of the major infamies of this war which will rank for the future historian on the same ethical level with [[Lidice Massacre|Lidice]]."&lt;ref&gt;Koestler, letter in ''Tribune'' magazine 15 September 1944, reprinted in Orwell, Collected Works, ''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'', p.374&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]] pleaded with Stalin and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to help Britain's Polish allies, to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War|first=Halik|last= Kochanski|year=2013|isbn=1846143586|pages=417–418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, without Soviet [[Air traffic control|air clearance]], Churchill sent over 200 low-level supply drops by the [[Royal Air Force]], the [[South African Air Force]], and the [[Polish Air Force]] under British High Command, in an operation known as the [[Warsaw airlift|Warsaw Airlift]]. Later, after gaining Soviet air clearance, the [[U.S. Army Air Force]] sent one high-level mass airdrop as part of [[Operation Frantic]].

Although the exact number of casualties is unknown, it is estimated that about 16,000 members of the Polish resistance were killed and about 6,000 badly wounded. In addition, between 150,000 and 200,000 Polish civilians died, mostly from mass executions. [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|Jews being harboured by Poles]] were exposed by German house-to-house clearances and mass evictions of entire neighbourhoods. German casualties totalled  over 2,000 to 17,000 soldiers killed and missing.&lt;ref name=stachnik/&gt; During the [[urban combat]], approximately 25% of Warsaw's buildings were destroyed. Following the surrender of Polish forces, German troops systematically levelled another 35% of the city block by block. Together with earlier damage suffered in the [[invasion of Poland|1939 invasion of Poland]] and the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] in 1943, over 85% of the city was destroyed by January 1945 when the course of the events in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] forced the Germans to abandon the city.

In 1944, Poland had been occupied by Nazi Germany for almost five years. The [[Armia Krajowa|Polish Home Army]] planned some form of rebellion against German forces. Germany was fighting a coalition of [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]], led by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States. The initial plan of the Home Army was to link up with the invading forces of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] as they liberated Europe from the Nazis. However, when the Soviet Army began its offensive in 1943, it became clear that Poland would be liberated by it instead of the Western Allies.

{{quote|In this country, we have one point from which every evil emanates. That point is Warsaw. If we didn't have Warsaw in the [[General Government]], we wouldn't have four-fifths of the difficulties with which we must contend. — German [[Governor-General]] [[Hans Frank]], [[Kraków]], 14 December 1943 &lt;ref&gt;Frank's diary quoted in [[Norman Davies|Davies, Norman]] (2004). ''[[Rising '44. The Battle for Warsaw]]''. London: Pan Books. {{ISBN|0-330-48863-5}}. p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Soviets and the Poles had a common enemy—Germany—but were working towards different post-war goals: the Home Army desired a pro-Western, capitalist Poland, but the Soviet leader Stalin intended to establish a pro-Soviet, socialist Poland. It became obvious that the advancing Soviet [[Red Army]] might not come to Poland as an ally but rather only as "the ally of an ally".&lt;ref&gt;''sojusznik naszych sojuszników'': Instytut Zachodni, ''Przegląd zachodni'', v.&amp;nbsp;47 no.&amp;nbsp;3–4 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Home Commander was, in his political thinking, pledged to the doctrine of two enemies, in accordance with which both Germany and Russia were seen as Poland's traditional enemies, and it was expected that support for Poland, if any, would come from the West".&lt;ref&gt;Jan. M. Ciechanowski. ''The Warsaw Rising of 1944''. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. London. 1974. p.137&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Warsaw_1944.jpg|thumb|[[Warsaw Old Town]] in flames during Warsaw Uprising]]

The Soviets and the Poles distrusted each other and [[Soviet partisans in Poland]] often clashed with a Polish resistance increasingly united under the Home Army's front.&lt;ref name="Soviets_and_AK" /&gt; Stalin broke off [[Poland–Russia relations|Polish–Soviet relations]] on 25 April 1943 after the Germans revealed the [[Katyn massacre]] of Polish army officers, and Stalin refused to admit to ordering the killings and denounced the claims as German propaganda. Afterwards, Stalin created the Rudenko Commission, whose goal was to blame the Germans for the war crime at all costs. The Western alliance accepted Stalin's words as truth in order to keep the Anti-Nazi alliance intact.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 48, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October, the Polish government-in-exile issued instructions to the effect that, if diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union were not resumed before the Soviet entry into Poland, Home Army forces were to remain underground pending further decisions.

However, the Home Army commander, [[Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski]], took a different approach, and on 20 November, he outlined his own plan, which became known as [[Operation Tempest]]. On the approach of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], local units of the Home Army were to harass the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' in the rear and co-operate with incoming Soviet units as much as possible. Although doubts existed about the military necessity of a major uprising, planning continued.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 206–208.&lt;/ref&gt;  General Bór-Komorowski and his civilian advisor were authorised by the government in exile to proclaim a general uprising whenever they saw fit.&lt;ref&gt;Winston S Churchill, ''The Second World War'', Vol. 6, Chapter IX, ''The Martyrdom of Warsaw'', 1955, Cassel&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eve of the battle==

The situation came to a head on 13 July 1944 as the Soviet offensive crossed the old [[Polish border]]. At this point the Poles had to make a decision: either initiate the uprising in the current difficult political situation and risk a lack of Soviet support, or fail to rebel and face [[Soviet propaganda]] describing the Home Army as impotent or worse, Nazi collaborators. They feared that if Poland was liberated by the Red Army, then the Allies would ignore the [[Polish government-in-exile|London-based Polish government]] in the aftermath of the war. The urgency for a final decision on strategy increased as it became clear that, after successful Polish-Soviet co-operation in the liberation of Polish territory (for example, in [[Operation Ostra Brama]]), [[NKVD|Soviet security forces]] behind the frontline shot or arrested Polish officers and forcibly conscripted lower ranks into the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East|Soviet-controlled forces]].&lt;ref name="Soviets_and_AK"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warsawuprising.com/paper/nkvd.htm The NKVD Against the Home Army (Armia Krajowa)], Warsaw Uprising, based on Andrzej Paczkowski. ''Poland, the "Enemy Nation"'', pp. 372–375, in ''Black Book of Communism. Crimes, Terror, Repression''. Harvard University Press, London, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 July, the High Command of the Home Army decided that the time to launch Operation Tempest in Warsaw was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was intended both as a political manifestation of Polish sovereignty and as a direct operation against the German occupiers.&lt;ref name="wufaq"/&gt; On 25 July, the Polish government-in-exile (without the knowledge and against the wishes of Polish Commander-in-Chief General [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]]&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 4 and Davies, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;) approved the plan for an uprising in Warsaw with the timing to be decided locally.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early summer of 1944, German plans required Warsaw to serve as the [[Festung Warschau|defensive centre of the area]] and to be held at all costs. The Germans had fortifications constructed and built up their forces in the area. This process slowed after the failed [[20 July plot]] to assassinate the Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]], and around that time, the Germans in Warsaw were weak and visibly demoralized.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1944.pl/index.php?a=site_text&amp;id=12352&amp;se_id=12352|title=Muzeum Powstania Warszawskiego|website=www.1944.pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of July, German forces in the area were reinforced.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt; On 27 July, the Governor of the Warsaw District, [[Ludwig Fischer]], called for 100,000 Polish men and women to report for work as part of a plan which envisaged the Poles constructing fortifications around the city.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants of Warsaw ignored his demand, and the Home Army command became worried about possible reprisals or mass round-ups, which would disable their ability to mobilize.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet forces were approaching Warsaw, and Soviet-controlled radio stations called for the Polish people to rise in arms.&lt;ref name="p1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 4 and Davies, pp. 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 July, the [[Union of Polish Patriots]], in a broadcast from Moscow, stated: "The Polish Army of Polish Patriots&amp;nbsp;... calls on the thousands of brothers thirsting to fight, to smash the foe before he can recover from his defeat&amp;nbsp;... Every Polish homestead must become a stronghold in the struggle against the invaders&amp;nbsp;... Not a moment is to be lost."&lt;ref&gt;''The Tragedy of Warsaw and its Documentation'', by the Duchess of Atholl,. D.B.E., Hon. D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.C.M. 1945, London&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 July, the first Soviet armoured units reached the outskirts of Warsaw, where they were counter-attacked by two German Panzer Corps: the 39th and 4th SS.&lt;ref name="Glantz"/&gt;  On 29 July 1944 Radio Station Kosciuszko located in Moscow emitted a few times its "Appeal to Warsaw" and called to "Fight The Germans!": "No doubt Warsaw already hears the guns of the battle which is soon to bring her liberation.&amp;nbsp;... The Polish Army now entering Polish territory, trained in the Soviet Union, is now joined to the People's Army to form the Corps of the Polish Armed Forces, the armed arm of our nation in its struggle for independence. Its ranks will be joined tomorrow by the sons of Warsaw. They will all together, with the Allied Army pursue the enemy westwards, wipe out the Hitlerite vermin from Polish land and strike a mortal blow at the beast of Prussian Imperialism."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warsawuprising.com/doc/kosciuszko.htm|title=Warsaw Uprising Documents: Radio Station Kosciuszko|website=www.warsawuprising.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bór-Komorowski and several  officers held a meeting on that day. [[Jan Nowak-Jeziorański]], who had  arrived from London, expressed the view that help from the Allies would be limited, but his views received no attention.&lt;ref name="The Warsaw Uprising of 1944"/&gt;

"In the early afternoon of 31 July the most important political and military leaders of the resistance had no intention of sending their troops into battle on 1 August. Even so, another late afternoon briefing of Bor-Komorowski's Staff was arranged for five o'clock(...) At about 5.30 p.m. Col 'Monter' arrived at the briefing, reporting
that the Russian tanks were already entering Praga and insisting on the immediate launching of the Home Army operations inside the city as otherwise it 'might be too late'. Prompted by 'Monter`s report, Bor-Komorowski decided that the time was ripe for the commencement of 'Burza' in Warsaw, in spite of his earlier conviction
to the contrary, twice expressed during the course of that day".&lt;ref&gt;Jan. M. Ciechanowski. The Warsaw Rising of 1944.  Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. London. 1974. p.239-240&lt;/ref&gt;

"Bor-Komorowski and Jankowski issued their final order for the insurrection when it
was erroneously reported to them that the Soviet tanks were entering Praga. Hence they assumed that the Russo-German battle for Warsaw was approaching its climax and that this presented them with an excellent opportunity to capture Warsaw before the Red Army entered the capital. The Soviet radio appeals calling upon the people of Warsaw to rise against the Germans, regardless of Moscow's intentions, had
very little influence on the Polish authorities responsible for the insurrection".&lt;ref name="Jan. M. Ciechanowski 1944. p.313"&gt;Jan. M. Ciechanowski. The Warsaw Rising of 1944.  Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. London. 1974. p.313&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing that the time for action had arrived, on 31 July, the Polish commanders General Bór-Komorowski and Colonel [[Antoni Chruściel]] ordered full mobilization of the forces for 17:00 the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The forces lacked equipment,&lt;ref name="WUmuseumcom"/&gt; because the Home Army had shuttled weapons to the east of the country before the decision to include Warsaw in Operation Tempest.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Other partisan groups subordinated themselves to Home Army command, and many volunteers joined during the fighting, including [[Polish Jews|Jews]] freed from the [[Gęsiówka]] [[concentration camp]] in the ruins of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]].&lt;ref&gt;The exact number of Poles of Jewish ancestry and Jews to take part in the uprising is a matter of controversy. General [[Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski]] estimated the number of Jewish Poles in Polish ranks at 1,000, other authors place it at between several hundred and 2,000. See for example: {{cite journal | author =Edward Kossoy | title =Żydzi w Powstaniu Warszawskim | publisher =Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morale among Jewish fighters was hurt by displays of antisemitism, with several former Jewish prisoners in combat units killed by antisemitic Poles.&lt;ref&gt;The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum ''[[Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933–1945]]'', [[Geoffrey P. Megargee]], Martin Dean, and Mel Hecker, Volume I, part B, pages 1514, quote: "The vast majority of liberated prisoners volunteered to fight in the uprising and
served the revolt in various capacities. A special Jewish fighting platoon and a Jewish brigade to construct barricades were formed from liberated prisoners. These units sustained heavy losses. The morale of the former prisoners was corroded, however, when antisemitism reared its ugly head in the fighting units; antisemitic Poles even killed several liberated prisoners who volunteered for combat units".&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonel Antoni Chruściel (codename "Monter") who commanded the Polish underground forces in Warsaw, divided his units into eight areas: the [[Sub-district I of Śródmieście (of Armia Krajowa)|Sub-district I of Śródmieście (Area I)]] which included [[Warszawa-Śródmieście]] and the Old Town; the [[Sub-district II of Żoliborz (of Armia Krajowa)|Sub-district II of Żoliborz (Area II)]] comprising [[Żoliborz]], [[Marymont]], and [[Bielany]]; the [[Sub-district III of Wola (of Armia Krajowa)|Sub-district III of Wola (Area III)]] in [[Wola]]; the [[Sub-district IV of Ochota (of Armia Krajowa)|Sub-district IV of Ochota (Area IV)]] in [[Ochota]]; the [[Sub-district V of Mokotów (of Armia Krajowa)|Sub-district V of Mokotów (Area V)]] in [[Mokotów]]; the [[Sub-district VI of Praga (of Armia Krajowa)|Sub-district VI of Praga (Area VI)]] in [[Praga]]; the [[Sub-district VII of Warsaw suburbs (of Armia Krajowa)|Sub-district VII of Warsaw suburbs (Area VII)]] for the [[Warsaw West County]]; and the Autonomous Region VIII of Okęcie (Area VIII) in [[Okęcie]]; while the units of the [[Kedyw|Directorate of Sabotage and Diversion]] (''Kedyw'') remained attached to the Uprising Headquarters.&lt;ref name="struktura"/&gt; On 20 September, the sub-districts were reorganized to align with the three areas of the city held by the Polish units. The entire force, renamed the Warsaw Home Army Corps ({{lang-pl|Warszawski Korpus Armii Krajowej|links=no}}) and commanded by General Antoni Chruściel – who was promoted from Colonel on 14 September – formed three infantry divisions (Śródmieście, Żoliborz and Mokotów).&lt;ref name=struktura/&gt;

The exact number of the foreign fighters (''obcokrajowcy'' in Polish), who fought in Warsaw for Poland's independence, is difficult to determine, taking into consideration the chaotic character of the Uprising causing their irregular registration. It is estimated that they numbered several hundred and represented at least 15 countries – Slovakia, Hungary, Great Britain, Australia, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, the United States of America, the Soviet Union, South Africa, Romania and even Germany and Nigeria.
These people – emigrants who had settled in Warsaw before the war, escapees from numerous POW, concentration and labor camps, and deserters from the German auxiliary forces – were absorbed in different fighting and supportive formations of the Polish underground. They wore the underground's red-white armband (the colors of the Polish national flag) and adopted the Polish traditional independence fighters’ slogan ‘Za naszą i waszą wolność’. Some of the ‘obcokrajowcy’ showed outstanding bravery in fighting the enemy and were awarded the highest decorations of the AK and the Polish government in exile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transnational-resistance.history.ox.ac.uk/2016/08/24/for-our-freedom-and-yours-discovering-the-transnational-dimension-of-the-warsaw-uprising-august-october-1944 Yaacov Falkov, "'For our freedom and yours’: Discovering the transnational dimension of the Warsaw Uprising (August–October 1944)"], Transnational Resistance Blog, 24.8.2016 {{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July 1944 the German units stationed in and around Warsaw were divided into three categories. The first and the most numerous was the garrison of Warsaw. As of 31 July, it numbered some 11,000 troops under General [[Rainer Stahel]].&lt;ref name="Powstanie Warszawskie 1944"/&gt;

[[File:Warsaw Uprising - Kaminski (1944).jpg|thumb|Commanding officers of the collaborationist ''[[Freiwillige]]'' (the Waffen-SS volunteers) brigade [[S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A.|R.O.N.A.]] during the Warsaw Uprising, August 1944]]
These well-equipped German forces prepared for the defence of the city's key positions for many months. Several hundred concrete bunkers and barbed wire lines protected the buildings and areas occupied by the Germans. Apart from the garrison itself, numerous army units were stationed on both banks of the Vistula and in the city. The second category was formed by police and SS under Col. Paul Otto Geibel, numbering initially 5,710 men,&lt;ref&gt;Borkiewicz, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; including ''[[Schutzpolizei (Nazi Germany)|Schutzpolizei]]'' and ''[[Waffen-SS]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The third category was formed by various auxiliary units, including detachments of the ''Bahnschutz'' (rail guard), ''Werkschutz'' (factory guard) and the Polish [[Volksdeutsche]] (ethnic [[German minority in Poland|Germans]] in Poland) and Soviet former [[POW]] of the ''[[Sonderdienst]]'' and ''Sonderabteilungen'' paramilitary units.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the uprising the German side received reinforcements on a daily basis. Stahel was replaced as overall commander by SS-General [[Erich von dem Bach]] in early August.&lt;ref name="Davies, pp. 666–667"&gt;Davies, pp. 666–667.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 20 August 1944, the German units directly involved with fighting in Warsaw comprised 17,000 men arranged in two battle groups: Battle Group Rohr (commanded by Major General Rohr), which included 1,700 soldiers of the anti-communist [[S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A.|S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A. ''Russkaya Osvoboditelnaya Narodnaya Armiya'']] (''Russian National Liberation Army'', also known as [[Kaminski Brigade]]) under German command made up of Russian, Belorussian and Ukrainian collaborators,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warsawuprising.com/paper/rona.htm|title=Warsaw Uprising: RONA, Bronislaw Kaminski|website=www.warsawuprising.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Battle Group Reinefarth commanded by SS-''Gruppenführer'' [[Heinz Reinefarth]], which consisted of [[Dirlewanger Brigade|Attack Group Dirlewanger]] (commanded by [[Oskar Dirlewanger]]), which included [[Aserbaidschanische Legion]] (part of the [[Ostlegionen]]),&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Michaelis Die SS-Sturmbrigade „Dirlewanger“.

The Nazi forces included about 5,000 regular troops; 4,000 [[Luftwaffe]] personnel (1,000 at [[Okęcie airport]], 700 at [[Bielany]], 1,000 in [[Boernerowo]], 300 at [[Służewiec]] and 1,000 in [[anti-air artillery]] posts throughout the city); as well as about 2,000 men of the Sentry Regiment Warsaw (''Wachtregiment Warschau''), including four infantry battalions (''Patz'', ''Baltz'', No. 996 and No. 997), and an [[SS]] reconnaissance squadron with ca. 350 men.&lt;ref name="Davies, pp. 666–667"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Warsaw Boy: A Memoir of a Wartime Childhood |first=Andrew |last=Borowiec |publisher=Penguin UK |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Cwl7AgAAQBAJ&amp;q=Attack+Group+Schmidt |year=2014 |ISBN=0241964040 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== W-hour or "Godzina W" ===
{{Main|The ‘W’ Hour}}
After days of hesitation, at 17:00 on 31 July, the Polish headquarters scheduled "W-hour" (from the Polish ''wybuch'', "explosion"), the moment of the start of the uprising for 17:00 on the following day.&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt; The decision was a strategic miscalculation because the under-equipped resistance forces were prepared and trained for a series of coordinated surprise dawn attacks. In addition, although many  units were already mobilized and waiting at assembly points throughout the city, the mobilization of thousands of young men and women was hard to conceal. Fighting started in advance of "W-hour", notably in [[Żoliborz]],&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 79 and Davies, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; and around [[Warsaw Uprising Square|Napoleon Square]] and Dąbrowski Square.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans had anticipated the possibility of an uprising, though they had not realized its size or strength.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, pp. 95–97.&lt;/ref&gt; At 16:30 Governor Fischer put the garrison on full alert.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, pp. 86–87 and Davies, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Warsaw Uprising - Small PASTa - Flamethrower.jpg|thumb|Resistance fighter armed with a flamethrower, 22 August 1944]]

That evening the resistance captured a major German arsenal, the main post office and power station and the Prudential building. However, Castle Square, the police district, and the airport remained in German hands.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 245–247.&lt;/ref&gt; The first days were crucial in establishing the battlefield for the rest of the fight. The resistance fighters were most successful in the [[Śródmieście, Warsaw|City Centre]], [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]], and [[Wola]] districts. However, several major German strongholds remained, and in some areas of Wola the Poles sustained heavy losses that forced an early retreat. In other areas such as [[Mokotów]], the attackers almost completely failed to secure any objectives and controlled only the residential areas. In [[Praga]], on the east bank of the Vistula, the Poles were sent back into hiding by a high concentration of German forces.&lt;ref name="Praga"/&gt; Most crucially, the fighters in different areas failed to link up with each other and with areas outside Warsaw, leaving each sector isolated from the others. After the first hours of fighting, many units adopted a more defensive strategy, while civilians began erecting barricades. Despite all the problems, by 4 August the majority of the city was in Polish hands, although some key strategic points remained untaken.&lt;ref name="Hanson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanson |first=Joanna |date=2004 |title=The Civilian Population and the Warsaw Uprising |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tj8nNWn-YeEC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=warsaw+uprising+4+august&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3irXU82cKYzTPMSEgdAJ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=warsaw%20uprising%204%20august&amp;f=false |location=Google Books |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=79 |accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uprising was intended to last a few days until Soviet forces arrived;&lt;ref name="Powstanie Warszawskie 19441"/&gt; however, this never happened, and the Polish forces had to fight with little outside assistance. The results of the first two days of fighting in different parts of the city were as follows:

* ''Area I'' (city centre and the Old Town): Units captured most of their assigned territory, but failed to capture areas with strong pockets of resistance from the Germans (the Warsaw University buildings, [[PAST (Poland)|PAST]] skyscraper, the headquarters of the German garrison in the [[Saxon Palace]], the [[Nur für Deutsche|German-only]] area near Szucha Avenue, and the bridges over the Vistula). They thus failed to create a central stronghold, secure communication links to other areas, or a secure land connection with the northern area of [[Żoliborz]] through the northern railway line and the [[Cytadela|Citadel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* ''Area II'' (Żoliborz, [[Marymont]], [[Bielany]]): Units failed to secure the most important military targets near Żoliborz. Many units retreated outside of the city, into the forests. Although they captured most of the area around Żoliborz, the soldiers of Colonel Mieczysław Niedzielski ("Żywiciel") failed to secure the Citadel area and break through German defences at [[Warszawa Gdańska station|Warsaw Gdańsk]] railway station.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Area III'' ([[Wola]]): Units initially secured most of the territory, but sustained heavy losses (up to 30%). Some units retreated into the forests, while others retreated to the eastern part of the area. In the northern part of Wola the soldiers of Colonel Jan Mazurkiewicz ("Radosław") managed to capture the German barracks, the German supply depot at Stawki Street, and the flanking position at the [[Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* ''Area IV'' ([[Ochota]]): The units mobilized in this area did not capture either the territory or the military targets (the [[Gęsiówka]] concentration camp, and the SS and [[Sicherheitspolizei|Sipo]] barracks on Narutowicz Square). After suffering heavy casualties most of the Home Army forces retreated to the forests west of Warsaw. Only two small units of approximately 200 to 300 men under Lieut. Andrzej Chyczewski ("Gustaw") remained in the area and managed to create strong pockets of resistance. They were later reinforced by units from the city centre. Elite units of the [[Kedyw]] managed to secure most of the northern part of the area and captured all of the military targets there. However, they were soon tied down by German tactical counter-attacks from the south and west.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}
* ''Area V'' ([[Mokotów]]): The situation in this area was very serious from the start of hostilities. The partisans aimed to capture the heavily defended Police Area (''Dzielnica policyjna'') on [[Rakowiecka]] Street, and establish a connection with the city centre through open terrain at the former airfield of [[Mokotów Field]]. As both of the areas were heavily fortified and could be approached only through open terrain, the assaults failed. Some units retreated into the forests, while others managed to capture parts of Dolny Mokotów, which was, however, severed from most communication routes to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Area VI'' ([[Praga]]): The Uprising was also started on the right bank of the Vistula, where the main task was to seize the bridges on the river and secure the bridgeheads until the arrival of the Red Army. It was clear that, since the location was far worse than that of the other areas, there was no chance of any help from outside. After some minor initial successes, the forces of Lt.Col. Antoni Żurowski ("Andrzej") were badly outnumbered by the Germans. The fights were halted, and the Home Army forces were forced back underground.&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt;
* ''Area VII'' (''[[Powiat]] warszawski''): this area consisted of territories outside Warsaw city limits. Actions here mostly failed to capture their targets.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

An additional area within the Polish command structure was formed by the units of the Directorate of Sabotage and Diversion or ''[[Kedyw]]'', an elite formation that was to guard the headquarters and was to be used as an "armed ambulance", thrown into the battle in the most endangered areas. These units secured parts of Śródmieście and Wola; along with the units of ''Area I'', they were the most successful during the first few hours.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Among the most notable primary targets that were not taken during the opening stages of the uprising were the airfields of [[Okęcie]] and [[Mokotów Field]], as well as the PAST skyscraper overlooking the city centre and the [[Warszawa Gdańska station|Gdańsk railway station]] guarding the passage between the centre and the northern borough of Żoliborz.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The leaders of the uprising counted only on the rapid entry of the Red Army in Warsaw (`on the second or third or, at the latest, by the seventh day of the fighting`&lt;ref&gt;Jan. M. Ciechanowski. The Warsaw Rising of 1944.  Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. London. 1974. p.247&lt;/ref&gt;) and were more prepared for a confrontation with the Russians. At this time, the head of the government in exile Mikolajczyk met with Stalin on August 3, 1944 in Moscow and raised the questions of his imminent arrival in Warsaw, the return to power of his government in Poland, as well as the Eastern borders of Poland, while categorically refusing to recognize the [[Curzon Line]] as the basis for negotiations.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Roberts 2008. p.212"&gt;Geoffrey Roberts. Stalin`s war. Yale university press. 2008. p.212&lt;/ref&gt;  In saying this, Mikolajczyk was well aware that the USSR and Stalin had repeatedly stated their demand for recognition of the [[Curzon line]] as the basis for negotiations and categorically refused to change their position. 23 March 1944 Stalin said 'he could not depart from the Curzon Line; in spite of Churchill's post-Teheran reference to his Curzon Line policy as one 'of force', he still believed it to be the only legitimate settlement'.&lt;ref&gt;Message from Mr Churchill to Marshal Stalin, 21 March 1944, No. 256. Correspondence, vol. i, pp. 211-12&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Warsaw uprising was actively used to achieve political goals. The question of assistance to the insurrection was not raised by Mikolajczyk, apparently for reasons that it might weaken the position in the negotiations. 'The substance of the two-and-a-half-hour discussion was a harsh disagreement about future of Poland, the Uprising - considered by the Poles as a bargaining chip - turned to be disadvantageous for Mikolajczyk`s position since it made him seem like a supplicant (...) Nothing was agreed about the Uprising.'&lt;ref&gt;Warsaw Uprising of 1944. Włodzimierz Borodziej. The University of Wisconsin Press. 2006. p.88&lt;/ref&gt; The question of helping the "Home Army" with weapons was only raised, but Stalin refused to discuss this question until the formation of a new government was decided.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Roberts 2008. p.212"/&gt;

The Uprising reached its [[apogee]] on 4 August when the Home Army soldiers managed to establish front lines in the westernmost boroughs of [[Wola]] and [[Ochota]]. However, it was also the moment at which the German army stopped its retreat westwards and began receiving reinforcements. On the same day SS General [[Erich von dem Bach]] was appointed commander of all the forces employed against the Uprising.&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt; German counter-attacks aimed to link up with the remaining German pockets and then cut off the Uprising from the Vistula river. Among the reinforcing units were forces under the command of [[Heinz Reinefarth]].&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt;

On 5 August Reinefarth's three attack groups started their advance westward along ''[[Wolska Street|Wolska]]'' and ''Górczewska'' streets toward the main East-West communication line of [[Aleje Jerozolimskie|Jerusalem Avenue]]. Their advance was halted, but the regiments began carrying out [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s orders: behind the lines, special SS, police and ''Wehrmacht'' groups went from house to house, shooting the inhabitants regardless of age or gender and burning their bodies.&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt; Estimates of civilians killed in Wola and Ochota range from 20,000 to 50,000,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; 40,000 by 8 August in Wola alone,&lt;ref name="Muzeum Powstania otwarte"/&gt; or as high as 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | edition = Warsaw | author = Jerzy Kłoczowski | title = O Powstaniu Warszawskim opowiada prof.

Despite the loss of Wola, the Polish resistance strengthened. ''Zośka'' and ''Wacek'' battalions managed to capture the ruins of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and liberate the [[Gęsiówka]] concentration camp, freeing about 350 Jews.&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt; The area became one of the main communication links between the resistance fighting in Wola and those defending the Old Town. On 7 August German forces were strengthened by the arrival of tanks using civilians as [[human shield]]s.&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt; After two days of heavy fighting they managed to bisect Wola and reach [[Bankowy Square]]. However, by then the net of barricades, street fortifications, and tank obstacles were already well-prepared; both sides reached a stalemate, with heavy house-to-house fighting.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Between 9 and 18 August pitched battles raged around the Old Town and nearby Bankowy Square, with successful attacks by the Germans and counter-attacks from the Poles. German tactics hinged on bombardment through the use of [[heavy artillery]]&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tactical bomber]]s, against which the Poles were unable to effectively defend, as they lacked anti-aircraft artillery weapons. Even clearly marked hospitals were dive-bombed by Stukas.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 333, 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] had already shown the danger a city can pose to armies which fight within it and the importance of local support, the Warsaw Uprising was probably the first demonstration that in an urban terrain, a vastly under-equipped force supported by the civilian population can hold its own against better-equipped professional soldiers—though at the cost of considerable sacrifice on the part of the city's residents.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The Poles held the Old Town until a decision to withdraw was made at the end of August. On successive nights until 2 September, the defenders of the Old Town withdrew through the sewers, which were a major means of communication between different parts of the Uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, pp. 132–133 and Davies, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of people were evacuated in this way. Those that remained were either shot or transported to concentration camps like Mauthausen and Sachsenhausen once the Germans regained control.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berling's landings ===
&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS SECTION --&gt;

Soviet attacks on the [[IV SS Panzer Corps|4th SS Panzer Corps]] east of Warsaw were renewed on 26 August, and the Germans were forced to retreat into Praga. The Soviet army under the command of [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] captured Praga and arrived on the east bank of the Vistula in mid-September. By 13 September, the Germans had destroyed the remaining bridges over the Vistula, signalling that they were abandoning all their positions east of the river.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, pp.138–141 and Davies, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Praga area, Polish units under the command of General [[Zygmunt Berling]] (thus sometimes known as ''berlingowcy'' – "the Berling men") fought on the Soviet side. Three patrols of his [[First Polish Army (1944–1945)|First Polish Army]] ({{lang|pl|1 Armia Wojska Polskiego}}) landed in the [[Czerniaków]] and [[Powiśle]] areas and made contact with Home Army forces on the night of 14/15 September. The artillery cover and air support provided by the Soviets was unable to effectively counter enemy machine-gun fire as the Poles crossed the river, and the landing troops sustained heavy losses.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 358–359.&lt;/ref&gt; Only small elements of the main units made it ashore (I and III battalions of 9th infantry regiment, 3rd Infantry Division).&lt;ref name="Berling landings"/&gt;

[[File:POL Berling monument, Warsaw 01.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Monument to [[Zygmunt Berling|General Berling]] in Warsaw]]

The limited landings by the 1st Polish Army represented the only external ground force which arrived to physically support the uprising; and even they were curtailed by the Soviet High Command due to the losses they took.&lt;ref name="Berling landings"/&gt;

The Germans intensified their attacks on the Home Army positions near the river to prevent any further landings, but were not able to make any significant advances for several days while Polish forces held those vital positions in preparation for a new expected wave of Soviet landings. Polish units from the eastern shore attempted several more landings, and from 15 to 23 September sustained heavy losses (including the destruction of all their landing boats and most of their other river crossing equipment).&lt;ref name="Berling landings"/&gt; Red Army support was inadequate.&lt;ref name="Berling landings"/&gt; After the failure of repeated attempts by the 1st Polish Army to link up with the resistance, the Soviets limited their assistance to sporadic artillery and air support. Conditions that prevented the Germans from dislodging the resistance also acted to prevent the Poles from dislodging the Germans. Plans for a river crossing were suspended "for at least 4 months", since operations against the [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army's]] five [[panzer division]]s were problematic at that point, and the commander of the 1st Polish Army, General Berling was relieved of his duties by his Soviet superiors.&lt;ref name="Soviets_and_AK"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard J.

On the night of 19 September, after no further attempts from the other side of the river were made and the promised evacuation of wounded did not take place, Home Army soldiers and landed elements of the 1st Polish Army were forced to begin a retreat from their positions on the bank of the river.&lt;ref name="Berling landings"/&gt; Out of approximately 900 men who made it ashore only a handful made it back to the eastern shore of the Vistula.&lt;ref&gt;Borodziej, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YHO0F65ifDIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=warsaw+uprising&amp;as_brr=3#PPA120,M1 p. 120] and Bell, J (2006).

The Poles were besieged in three areas of the city: Śródmieście, Żoliborz and Mokotów.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 1939 Warsaw had roughly 1,350,000 inhabitants. Over a million were still living in the city at the start of the Uprising. In Polish-controlled territory, during the first weeks of the Uprising, people tried to recreate the normal day-to-day life of their free country. Cultural life was vibrant, both among the soldiers and civilian population, with theatres, post offices, newspapers and similar activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 1 | publisher = Czytelnik | page = 169 | last = Nawrocka-Dońska | first = Barbara | title = Powszedni dzień dramatu | location = Warsaw | year = 1961 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boys and girls of the [[Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego|Polish Scouts]] acted as couriers for an underground postal service, risking their lives daily to transmit any information that might help their people.&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Muzeum Martyrologii i Walki Jeńców Wojennych w Łambinowicach | page = 70 | last = Tomczyk | first = Damian | title = Młodociani uczestnicy powstania warszawskiego | location = Łambinowice | year = 1982|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the Uprising, lack of food, medicine, overcrowding and indiscriminate German air and artillery assault on the city made the civilian situation more and more desperate.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Booby traps, such as thermite-laced candy pieces, may have also been used in German-controlled districts of Warsaw; targeting Polish youth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Food shortages ===
As the Uprising was supposed to be relieved by the Soviets in a matter of days, the Polish underground did not predict food shortages would be a problem. However, as the fighting dragged on, the inhabitants of the city faced hunger and starvation. A major break-through took place on 6 August, when Polish units recaptured the [[Haberbusch i Schiele]] brewery complex at Ceglana Street. From that time on the citizens of Warsaw lived mostly on barley from the brewery's warehouses. Every day up to several thousand people organized into cargo teams reported to the brewery for bags of barley and then distributed them in the city centre. The barley was then ground in coffee grinders and boiled with water to form a so-called spit-soup ({{lang-pl|pluj-zupa}}). The "Sowiński" Battalion managed to hold the brewery until the end of the fighting.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Another serious problem for civilians and soldiers alike was a shortage of water.&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt; By mid-August most of the water conduits were either out of order or filled with corpses. In addition, the main water pumping station remained in German hands.&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt; To prevent the spread of epidemics and provide the people with water, the authorities ordered all janitors to supervise the construction of water wells in the backyards of every house. On 21 September the Germans blew up the remaining pumping stations at Koszykowa Street and after that the public wells were the only source of potable water in the besieged city.&lt;ref name="Stacja Filtrów"/&gt; By the end of September, the city centre had more than 90 functioning wells.&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt;

Before the Uprising the Bureau of Information and Propaganda of the Home Army had set up a group of war correspondents. Headed by [[Antoni Bohdziewicz]], the group made three [[newsreel]]s and over 30,000 meters of film tape documenting the struggles. The first newsreel was shown to the public on 13 August in the Palladium cinema at Złota Street.&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt; In addition to films, dozens of newspapers appeared from the very first days of the uprising.

The ''[[Błyskawica radiostation|Błyskawica]]'' long-range radio transmitter, assembled on 7 August in the city centre, was run by the military, but was also used by the recreated [[Polish Radio]] from 9 August.&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt; It was on the air three or four times a day, broadcasting news programmes and appeals for help in Polish, English, German and French, as well as reports from the government, patriotic poems and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Orbis | page = 112 | last = Zadrożny | first = Stanisław | title = Tu—Warszawa; Dzieje radiostacji powstańczej "Błyskawica" | location = London | year = 1964 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only such radio station in German-held Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Project InPosterum (corporate author) | title = Warsaw Uprising: Radio 'Lighting' (Błyskawica) | accessdate =8 May 2007 | url = http://www.warsawuprising.com/paper/radio.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the speakers appearing on the resistance radio were [[Jan Nowak-Jeziorański]],&lt;ref name="Courier from Warsaw"/&gt; Zbigniew Świętochowski, Stefan Sojecki, [[Jeremi Przybora]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Adam Nogaj | title = Radiostacja Błyskawica|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Ward (airman)|John Ward]], a war correspondent for ''[[The Times]]'' of London.&lt;ref name="John Ward"/&gt;

According to many historians, a major cause of the eventual failure of the uprising was the almost complete lack of outside support and the late arrival of that which did arrive.&lt;ref name="wufaq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glantz"/&gt; The Polish government-in-exile carried out frantic diplomatic efforts to gain support from the Western Allies prior to the start of battle but the allies would not act without Soviet approval. The Polish government in London asked the British several times to send an allied mission to Poland.&lt;ref name="Soviets_and_AK"/&gt; However, the British mission did not arrive until December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after their arrival, they met up with Soviet authorities, who arrested and imprisoned them.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the mission's deputy commander, it was "a complete failure".&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, from August 1943 to July 1944, over 200 British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) flights dropped an estimated 146 Polish personnel trained in Great Britain, over 4,000 containers of supplies, and $16 million in banknotes and gold to the Home Army.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only support operation which ran continuously for the duration of the Uprising were night supply drops by long-range planes of the RAF, other [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] air forces, and units of the [[Polish Air Force]], which had to use distant airfields in Italy, reducing the amount of supplies they could carry. The RAF made 223 sorties and lost 34 aircraft. The effect of these airdrops was mostly psychological—they delivered too few supplies for the needs of the resistance, and many airdrops landed outside Polish-controlled territory.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

From 4 August the Western Allies began supporting the Uprising with airdrops of munitions and other supplies.&lt;ref name="WUairdrops" /&gt; Initially the flights were carried out mostly by the ''1568th Polish Special Duties Flight'' of the [[Polish Air Force]] (later renamed [[No. 301 Polish Bomber Squadron]]) stationed in [[Bari]] and [[Brindisi]] in Italy, flying [[B-24 Liberator]], [[Handley Page Halifax]] and [[Douglas C-47 Dakota]] planes. Later on, at the insistence of the Polish government-in-exile,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} they were joined by the Liberators of 2 Wing –[[31 Squadron SAAF|No.31]] and [[34 Squadron SAAF|No. 34]] Squadrons of the [[South African Air Force]] based at [[Foggia]] in Southern Italy, and Halifaxes, flown by [[No. 148 Squadron RAF|No. 148]] and No. 178 RAF Squadrons. The drops by British, Polish and South African forces continued until 21 September. The total weight of allied drops varies according to source (104 tons,&lt;ref name="Airlift to Warsaw. The Rising of 19442" /&gt; 230 tons&lt;ref name="WUairdrops" /&gt; or 239 tons&lt;ref name="Soviets_and_AK" /&gt;), over 200 flights were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1944.pl/index.php?a=site_text&amp;id=12440&amp;se_id=12448 ALLIED AIRMEN OVER WARSAW] at Warsaw Rising Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union did not allow the Western Allies to use its airports for the airdrops&lt;ref name="wufaq" /&gt; for several weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Pincers (August 1944 – March 1945) |episodelink= |url= |accessdate= |series=[[The World at War]] |serieslink= |network=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] |station= |city= |airdate= 20 March 1974 |began= |ended= |season= |seriesno= |number= 19 |minutes= 21 |time= |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote=Stalin was very suspicious of the underground, but it was utterly cruel that he wouldn't even try to get supplies in.

[[W. Averell Harriman|Averell Harriman]] U.S. Ambassador to Russia 1943–46 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the planes had to use bases in the United Kingdom and Italy which reduced their carrying weight and number of sorties. The Allies' specific request for the use of landing strips made on 20 August was denied by Stalin on 22 August.&lt;ref name="Fairly" /&gt; Stalin referred to the Polish resistance as "a handful of criminals"&lt;ref&gt;Kamil Tchorek, [http://www.warsawuprising.com/paper/times_online.htm Escaped British Airman Was Hero of Warsaw Uprising]&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that the Uprising was inspired by "enemies of the Soviet Union".&lt;ref name="WUairfields" /&gt; Thus, by denying landing rights to Allied aircraft on Soviet-controlled territory the Soviets vastly limited effectiveness of Allied assistance to the Uprising, and even fired at Allied airplanes which carried supplies from Italy and strayed into Soviet-controlled airspace.&lt;ref name="Fairly" /&gt;

American support was also limited. After Stalin's objections to supporting the uprising, British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] telegraphed U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on 25 August and proposed sending planes in defiance of Stalin, to "see what happens". Unwilling to upset Stalin before the [[Yalta Conference]], Roosevelt replied on 26 August: "I do not consider it advantageous to the long-range general war prospect for me to join you".&lt;ref name="Fairly" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/presents/shows/warsaw.rising/interactive/timeline.warsaw/frameset.exclude.html Warsaw Uprising CNN Special]'' – 26 August.

Finally on 18 September the Soviets allowed a [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] flight of 107 [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the [[Eighth Air Force]]'s [[3d Air Division|3rd Division]] to re-fuel and reload at Soviet airfields used in [[Operation Frantic]], but it was too little too late.

Between 13 and 30 September Soviet aircraft commenced their own re-supply missions, dropping arms, medicines and food supplies. Initially these supplies were dropped in canisters without parachutes&lt;ref&gt;Davies (2004), pp.359&lt;/ref&gt; which led to damage and loss of the contents.&lt;ref name=Churchill&gt;Churchill (1953) pp.144–145&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a large number of canisters fell into German hands. The Soviet Air Forces flew 2,535 re-supply sorties with small bi-plane [[Polikarpov Po-2]]'s, delivering a total of 156 50-mm mortars, 505 anti-tank rifles, 1,478 sub-machine guns, 520 rifles, 669 carbines, 41,780 hand grenades, 37,216 mortar shells, over 3 million [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]], 131.2 tons of food and 515&amp;nbsp;kg of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Доклад командования 1-го Белорусского фронта Верховному главнокомандующему И.В.

Although German air defence over the Warsaw area itself was almost non-existent, about 12% of the 296 planes taking part in the operations were lost because they had to fly {{convert|1600|km|abbr=off}} out and the same distance back over heavily defended enemy territory (112 out of 637 Polish and 133 out of 735 British and South African airmen were shot down).&lt;ref name="WUairfields" /&gt; Most of the drops were made during the night, at no more than {{convert|30|-|90|m|abbr=on|-1}} altitude, and poor accuracy left many parachuted packages stranded behind German-controlled territory (only about 50 tons of supplies, less than 50% delivered, was recovered by the resistance).&lt;ref name="WUairdrops" /&gt;

The role of the Red Army during the Warsaw Uprising remains controversial and is still disputed by historians.&lt;ref name="Glantz" /&gt; The Uprising started when the Red Army appeared on the city's doorstep, and the Poles in Warsaw were counting on Soviet front capturing or forwarding beyond the city in a matter of days. This basic scenario of an uprising against the Germans, launched a few days before the arrival of Allied forces, played out successfully in a number of European capitals, such as [[Liberation of Paris|Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Prague uprising|Prague]]. However, despite easy capture of area south-east of Warsaw barely {{convert|10|km|abbr=off}} from the city centre and holding these positions for about 40 days, the Soviets did not extend any effective aid to the resistance within Warsaw. At that time city outskirts were defended by the under-manned and under-equipped [[73rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|German 73rd Infantry Division]] which was destroyed many times on the Eastern Front and was yet-again being reconstituted.&lt;ref&gt;''SS: The Waffen-SS War in Russia 1941–45'' Relevant page viewable via [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;id=HAMd81LJJs4C&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=73rd+infantry+division&amp;prev=https://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3D73rd%2Binfantry%2Bdivision%26lr%3D%26start%3D10&amp;sig=k-va3MBk58jCUKatCmNi6UU10BQ Google book search]&lt;/ref&gt; The weak German defence forces did not experience any significant Soviet pressure during that period, which effectively allowed them to strengthen German forces fighting against uprising in the city itself.

The Red Army was fighting intense battles further to the south of Warsaw, to seize and maintain bridgeheads over the Vistula river, and to the north of the city, to gain bridgeheads over the river Narew. The best German armoured divisions were fighting on those sectors. Despite the fact, both of these objectives had been mostly secured by September. Yet the Soviet 47th Army did not move into [[Praga]] (Warsaw's suburbs) on the right bank of the Vistula, until 11 September (when the Uprising was basically over). In three days the Soviets quickly gained control of the suburb, a few hundred meters from the main battle on the other side of the river, as the resistance by the German 73rd Division collapsed quickly. Had the Soviets done this in early August, the crossing of the river would have been easier, as the Poles then held considerable stretches of the riverfront. However, by mid-September a series of German attacks had reduced the Poles to holding one narrow stretch of the riverbank, in the district of [[Czerniaków]]. The Poles were counting on the Soviet forces to cross to the left bank where the main battle of the uprising was occurring. Though Berling's communist 1st Polish Army did cross the river, their support from the Soviets was inadequate and the main Soviet force did not follow them.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, pp. 148–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the reasons given for the collapse of the Uprising was the reluctance of the Soviet Red Army to help the Polish resistance. On 1 August, the day of Uprising, the Soviet advance was halted by a direct order from the Kremlin.&lt;ref name="Nowak" /&gt; Soon afterwards the Soviet tank units stopped receiving any oil from their depots.&lt;ref name="Nowak" /&gt; Soviets knew of the planned outbreak from their agents in Warsaw and, more importantly, directly from the Polish Prime Minister [[Stanisław Mikołajczyk]], who informed them of the Polish Home Army uprising plans:&lt;ref name="Nowak" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;according to Polish documents, Mikołajczyk informed the Soviet foreign minister Molotov at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm on 31 July (Ciechanowski (1974), p. 68)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Soviet side was informed post-factum. "The Russians learned about possibility for the first time from Mikolajczyk, at about 9 p.m. on 31 July, that is about 3 hours after Bor-Komorowski had given the order for the insurrection to begin". .&lt;ref&gt;Jan.

One way or the other, the presence of Soviet tanks in nearby [[Wołomin]] 15 kilometers to the east of Warsaw had sealed the decision of the Home Army leaders to launch the Uprising. However, as a result of the initial [[Battle of Radzymin (1944)|battle of Radzymin]] in the final days of July, these advance units of the Soviet 2nd Tank Army were pushed out of Wołomin and back about {{convert|10|km|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;''The Soviet Conduct of Tactical Maneuver: Spearhead of the Offensive by David M Glantz''.

On 1 August 1944, the underground [[Armia Krajowa|Polish Home Army]], being in contact with and loyal to the Polish government-in-exile in London, began offensive operations in Warsaw, in an attempt to free the city from the occupying German forces before the Red Army could secure the capital. [[Zygmunt Berling]] became the deputy commander of the Polish Army in the USSR on 22 July 1944. With his own army stopped on the [[Vistula River]] and facing Warsaw itself, and without first consulting his Soviet superiors, Berling may have independently issued orders to engage the German enemy and to come to the aid of the Polish resistance. But it was a small landing without any tactical support from Berling or other Soviet units that could not make a difference in the situation of Warsaw.  Yet this behaviour may have caused Berlings' dismissal from his post soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Michta | first = Andrew | title = Red Eagle : the army in Polish politics, 1944–1988 | publisher = Hoover Institution Press | location = Stanford, Calif | year = 1990 | isbn = 978-0-8179-8862-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/redeaglearmyinpo0000mich }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Ff065RmrAsC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=Zygmunt+Berling&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BByFDI04Yb&amp;sig=ZKvo7XnXDs__Qze3agX4YwHTe3A&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lP4oS6LSCo3c7AOg7ZHEBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBAQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Zygmunt%20Berling&amp;f=false p. 33].

When Stalin and Churchill met face-to-face in October 1944, Stalin told Churchill that the lack of Soviet support was a direct result of a major reverse in the Vistula sector in August, which had to be kept secret for strategic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt; All contemporary German sources assumed that the Soviets were trying to link up with the resistance, and they believed it was their defence that prevented the Soviet advance rather than a reluctance to advance on the part of the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, as part of their strategy the Germans published propaganda accusing both the British and Soviets of abandoning the Poles.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 282–283.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet units which reached the outskirts of Warsaw in the final days of July 1944 had advanced from the [[1st Belorussian Front]] in Western Ukraine as part of the [[Lublin–Brest Offensive]], between the [[Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive]] on its left and [[Operation Bagration]] on its right.&lt;ref name="Glantz" /&gt; These two flanking operations were colossal defeats for the German army and completely destroyed a large number of German formations.&lt;ref name="Glantz" /&gt; As a consequence, the Germans at this time were desperately trying to put together a new force to hold the line of the Vistula, the last major river barrier between the Red Army and Germany proper, rushing in units in various stages of readiness from all over Europe. These included many infantry units of poor quality,&lt;ref name="DWS" /&gt; and 4–5 high quality Panzer Divisions in the 39th Panzer Corps and 4th SS Panzer Corps&lt;ref name="Glantz" /&gt; pulled from their refits.&lt;ref name="DWS" /&gt;

Other explanations for Soviet conduct are possible. The Red Army geared for a major thrust into the Balkans through Romania in mid-August and a large proportion of Soviet resources was sent in that direction, while the offensive in Poland was put on hold.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin had made a strategic decision to concentrate on occupying Eastern Europe, rather than on making a thrust toward Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; The capture of Warsaw was not essential for the Soviets, as they had already seized a series of convenient bridgeheads to the south of Warsaw, and were concentrating on defending them against vigorous German counterattacks.&lt;ref name="Glantz" /&gt; Finally, the Soviet High Command may not have developed a coherent or appropriate strategy with regard to Warsaw because they were badly misinformed.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; Propaganda from the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] minimized the strength of the Home Army and portrayed them as Nazi sympathizers.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 440–441.&lt;/ref&gt; Information submitted to Stalin by intelligence operatives or gathered from the frontline was often inaccurate or omitted key details.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Davies, pp. 154–155, 388–389.&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly because the operatives were unable, due to the harsh political climate, to express opinions or report facts honestly, they "deliberately resorted to writing nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[David Glantz]] (military historian and a retired US Army colonel, as well as a member of the Russian Federation's Academy of Natural Sciences), the Red Army was simply unable to extend effective support to the uprising, which began too early, regardless of Stalin's political intentions.&lt;ref name="Glantz" /&gt;  German military capabilities in August—early September were sufficient to halt any Soviet assistance to the Poles in Warsaw, were it intended.&lt;ref name="Glantz" /&gt; In addition, Glantz argued that Warsaw would be a costly city to clear of Germans and an unsuitable location as a start point for subsequent Red Army offensives.&lt;ref name="Glantz" /&gt;

Declassified documents from Soviet archives reveal that Stalin gave instructions to cut off the Warsaw resistance from any outside help. The urgent orders issued to the Red Army troops in Poland on 23 August 1944 stipulated that the Home Army units in Soviet-controlled areas should be prevented from reaching Warsaw and helping the Uprising, their members apprehended and disarmed. Only from mid-September, under pressure from the Western Allies, the Soviets began to provide some limited assistance to the resistance.&lt;ref name="Gibianskii" /&gt;

Modern Russian historians generally hold the view that the failure of the uprising in Warsaw was caused primarily by the mistakes of the leadership of the uprising. They point out that in July 1944, according to the Directive of the command, the Soviet troops did not have the goal of attacking Warsaw, but only to the suburbs of Warsaw – Prague with access to the Vistula river line. Since the Soviet command understood that it was unlikely to be possible to capture the bridges over the Vistula and the Germans would blow them up. The Soviet forces aimed to advance in the northern direction with the capture of East Prussia and with the priority task of reaching the line of the Vistula and Narew rivers and capturing bridgeheads. Then the offensive against East Prussia was to begin from these bridgeheads. ("on the West Bank of the Narew river in the area of Pultusk, Serotsk and South and North of Warsaw – on the West Bank of the Vistula river in the area of Demblin, Zvolen, Solec.

The left wing of the front to capture a bridgehead on the West Bank of the Vistula river in the area of Demblin, Zvolen, solets. The captured bridgeheads should be used for a strike in the North-West direction in order to collapse the enemy's defenses along the Narev and Vistula rivers and thus facilitate the crossing of the Narev river to the left wing of the 2nd Belorussian front and the Vistula river. The Vistula – to the Central armies of its front. In the future, keep in mind to advance in the General direction of Torn and Lodz.

The liberation of Warsaw was planned by a flanking maneuver after the start of a General offensive in the direction of East Prussia and Berlin. This is exactly how it happened, only in January 1945. The AK leadership made a mistake, it took the left flank of the 2nd Tank army, which was advancing to north, for the vanguard, which was allegedly advancing on Warsaw. And the order was given to start the uprising, which led to defeat. A terrible mistake, but in essence inevitable, if the leadership of the uprising took a political line about the lack of coordination with the Soviet command, if the goal was that Warsaw should be freed from the Germans 'by Polish effort alone 12 hours before the entry of the Soviets into the capital'.&lt;ref&gt;Jan.

=== Hungarian support ===
{{More citations needed section|date=January 2020}}
Several units of the [[Royal Hungarian Army]] were stationed around Warsaw before and during the uprising. Hungarians and Poles have maintained very friendly relations for centuries and neither individual soldiers nor their commanders wished to break this tradition. Hungarian military bands often played Polish patriotic songs and anthems which were banned under the death penalty by the Germans, or rendered aid in their field hospitals to wounded Polish partisans. Although their troops were formally subordinated to the German 9th army, they refused to participate in the quelling of the uprising. Instead they supported the Polish side as much as it was possible without actually switching sides and getting into an open conflict with the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Benkő |first1=Tibor |title=Memorial to Hungarian soldiers assisting 1944 Warsaw uprising is inaugurated in Warsaw |url=https://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-defence/news/memorial-to-hungarian-soldiers-assisting-1944-warsaw-uprising-is-inaugurated-in-warsaw |publisher=Hungarian Ministry of Defense |accessdate=7 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since August 1943 the elite Hungarian 1st Cavalry Division were stationed on the outskirts of the Polish capital, in the forests of Kampinos. The unit was withdrawn from the front for recuperation and refitting. When the uprising began, the Hungarian soldiers passed equipment, food, supplies, even weapons and ammunition to Polish fighters who they were supposed to disarm and capture. They also informed them about German plans and troop movements. Very often the two sides agreed to feign a "partisan attack" on supply vehicles, and after a mock firefight the Hungarians "fled" and let the Poles "pillage" their supplies, which often included large shipments of firearms. At other times they let Polish units through their lines but blocked the way from Germans who were chasing them. At other times individual Polish soldiers found asylum at Hungarian units who "captured" and refused to extradite them to the Germans. There were several incidents when Hungarian soldiers threatened Germans with weapons to protect these refugees. When the Germans ordered the 5th Hungarian infantry division to withdraw from Warsaw's vicinity, they left behind equipment and ammunition for the partisans. They also frequently provided them with Hungarian uniforms. Ironically the Poles and the Hungarians mostly communicated in German language which they both knew.

During one event, when the German radio reconnaissance successfully located a strategically important Polish radio station, the Hungarian radio operators thwarted the German raid to capture the station by jamming German radio frequencies.

The 23rd Reserve Division, commanded by Major General Gusztáv Deseő passed on information to the Polish partisans about which bridges can be destroyed in the area without making the Germans suspicious of the Hungarians. In the area between the towns of Tomaszów Mazowiecki and Radom, near Diabla Góra (Devil's Hill) the same unit got into a firefight with an approximately 200-strong German military police detachment and freed several hundred Polish and Jewish prisoners from a train headed to the concentration camp at Pruszków.

This cooperation wasn't unofficial or occasional. General Antal Vattay, commander of the Hungarian troops was in secret talks of the leadership of the Polish resistance and held several meetings at various locations. These negotiations were conducted with the knowledge and permission of the Hungarian government and personally Admiral Miklós Horthy, Regent of Hungary. As it was feared that the Germans may try to arrest Vattay, he was recalled to Budapest and replaced with General Béla Lengyel, who used to be the military attaché to the Hungarian embassy in Warsaw before the war. If possible, he was even more sympathetic to the Polish case than his predecessor and personally knew some of the leaders of the Polish resistance, including General Bór-Komorowski. Ultimately the Hungarians offered to switch sides and openly engage German troops in combat if the Polish leaders could provide guarantees that the Soviets later won't treat them as enemy combatants. As the Poles were not in the position to make such assurances, this never happened.

There also are several recorded cases of Hungarian soldiers defecting to the Polish side and fighting with them. Some of them died in the firefights, and some were executed by the Germans. The 1st Cavalry Division also participated in the rescue of Polish civilians from German atrocities. At least 1,600 Warsaw families got away from SS troops on Hungarian military vehicles. Many of them were smuggled to Hungary. Ksenia Martyszówna, a famous Polish interwar actress, known as Xenia Grey, was one of them.&lt;ref&gt;A magyar korridor: ''Varsó 1944 (The Hungarian Corridor: Warsaw 1944)'' documentary, 2016, directed by Levente Jamrik&lt;/ref&gt;

By the first week of September both German and Polish commanders realized that the Soviet army was unlikely to act to break the stalemate. The Germans reasoned that a prolonged Uprising would damage their ability to hold Warsaw as the frontline; the Poles were concerned that continued resistance would result in further massive casualties. On 7 September, General Rohr proposed negotiations, which Bór-Komorowski agreed to pursue the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; Over 8, 9 and 10 September about 20,000 civilians were evacuated by agreement of both sides, and Rohr recognized the right of Home Army soldiers to be treated as military combatants.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 332–334.&lt;/ref&gt; The Poles suspended talks on the 11th, as they received news that the Soviets were advancing slowly through Praga.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, the arrival of the 1st Polish army breathed new life into the resistance and the talks collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Warsaw Uprising Surrender- 5 of October 1944.jpg|thumb|left|Surrender of the Warsaw Uprising resistance, 5 October 1944]]

However, by the morning of 27 September, the Germans had retaken Mokotów.&lt;ref&gt;Borodziej, p. 125 and Borowiec, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Talks restarted on 28 September.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; In the evening of 30 September, Żoliborz fell to the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Borodziej, p. 126 and Borowiec, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The Poles were being pushed back into fewer and fewer streets, and their situation was ever more desperate.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 401–402.&lt;/ref&gt; On the 30th, Hitler decorated von dem Bach, Dirlewanger and Reinefarth, while in London General Sosnkowski was dismissed as Polish commander-in-chief. Bór-Komorowski was promoted in his place, even though he was trapped in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 408–409.&lt;/ref&gt; Bór-Komorowski and Prime Minister Mikołajczyk again appealed directly to Rokossovsky and Stalin for a Soviet intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 409–411.&lt;/ref&gt; None came. According to Soviet Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]], who was by this time at the Vistula front, both he and Rokossovsky advised Stalin against an offensive because of heavy Soviet losses.&lt;ref&gt;''The Memoirs of Marshal Zhukov'' (London, 1971) pp. 551–552, quoted in Davies, pp. 420–421.&lt;/ref&gt;

The capitulation order of the remaining Polish forces was finally signed on 2 October. All fighting ceased that evening.&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--WUTIME says 18:00; Davies says 19:00--&gt; According to the agreement, the ''Wehrmacht'' promised to treat Home Army soldiers in accordance with the [[Geneva Convention]], and to treat the civilian population humanely.&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt;

The next day the Germans began to disarm the Home Army soldiers. They later sent 15,000 of them to POW camps in various parts of Germany. Between 5,000 and 6,000 resistance fighters decided to blend into the civilian population hoping to continue the fight later. The entire civilian population of Warsaw was expelled from the city and sent to a transit camp ''Durchgangslager'' 121 in [[Pruszków]].&lt;ref name="Zaborski"/&gt; Out of 350,000–550,000 civilians who passed through the camp, 90,000 were sent to labour camps in the Third Reich, 60,000 were shipped to death and concentration camps (including [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]], [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], and [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]], among others), while the rest were transported to various locations in the [[General Government]] and released.&lt;ref name="Zaborski"/&gt;

The Eastern Front remained static in the Vistula sector, with the Soviets making no attempt to push forward, until the [[Vistula–Oder Offensive]] began on 12 January 1945. Almost entirely destroyed, Warsaw was liberated from the Germans on 17 January 1945 by the Red Army and the [[First Polish Army (1944–1945)|First Polish Army]].&lt;ref name="wutime"/&gt;

[[File:Destroyed Warsaw, capital of Poland, January 1945.jpg|thumb|[[Warsaw Old Town]]; after the Warsaw Uprising, 85% of the city [[Aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising|was deliberately destroyed]] by the German forces.]]

The destruction of the Polish capital was planned before the start of World War II. On 20 June 1939, while Adolf Hitler was visiting an architectural bureau in [[Würzburg]] am Main, his attention was captured by a project of a future German town – "Neue deutsche Stadt Warschau". According to the [[Pabst Plan]] Warsaw was to be turned into a provincial German city. It was soon included as a part of the great [[Germanization]] plan of the East; the genocidal ''[[Generalplan Ost]]''. The failure of the Warsaw Uprising provided an opportunity for Hitler to begin the transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Niels Gutschow, Barbarta Klain: Vernichtung und Utopie.

After the remaining population had been expelled, the Germans continued the destruction of the city.&lt;ref name="wufaq"/&gt; Special groups of German engineers were dispatched to burn and demolish the remaining buildings.

By January 1945, 85% of the buildings were destroyed: 25% as a result of the Uprising, 35% as a result of systematic German actions after the uprising, and the rest as a result of the earlier [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], and the [[Invasion of Poland|September 1939 campaign]].&lt;ref name="wufaq"/&gt; Material losses are estimated at 10,455 buildings, 923 historical buildings (94%), 25 churches, 14 libraries including the [[National Library of Poland|National Library]], 81 primary schools, 64 high schools, [[University of Warsaw]] and [[Warsaw University of Technology]], and most of the historical monuments.&lt;ref name="wufaq"/&gt; Almost a million inhabitants lost all of their possessions.&lt;ref name="wufaq"/&gt; The exact amount of losses of private and public property as well as pieces of art, monuments of science and culture is unknown but considered enormous.

===Casualties (including both Uprising civilian  soldiers and civilians)===

The exact number of casualties on both sides is unknown. Estimates of Polish casualties fall into roughly similar ranges.

Estimates of German casualties differ widely. Though the figure of 9,000 German WIA is generally accepted and generates no controversy, there is little agreement as to German irrecoverable losses (KIA+MIA). Until the 1990s the Eastern and the Western historiography stuck to two widely different estimates, the former claiming 17,000 and the latter 2,000. The 17,000 figure was first coined by a 1947 issue of a Warsaw historical journal ''Dzieje Najnowsze'', allegedly based on estimates made by Bach Zelewski when interrogated by his Polish captors (and divided into 10,000 KIA and 7,000 MIA). This figure was initially repeated in West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. a German scholar specialized in Polish history, Hans E. Roos, in ''Der Tag'' of 01.08.1954 repeated the 17,000 KIA+MIA figure, referred after Klaus-Peter Friedrich, ''Kontaminierte Erinnerung: Vom Einfluß der Kriegspropaganda auf das Gedenken an die Warschauer Aufstände von 1943 und 1944'', [in:] ''Zeitschrift fur Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung'' 55/3 ( 2008), p. 427&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1962 a scholarly monograph by Hanns Krannhals coined the 2,000 estimate.&lt;ref&gt;"auf deutscher Seite während des Aufstandes 2 000 Angehörige deutsch geführer Verbände gefallen und 9 000 verwunder worden sind", see Hanns von Krannhals, ''Der Warschauer Aufstand'', Frankfurt a/M 1962, p. 215; Krannhals dismissed the 17,000 figure as "Bach’s overestimates which unfortunately made it to the Polish literature"&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the 1,570 German KIA figure officially reported by Bach in October 1944, rounded up with estimates related to first few days when Bach was not in charge and to losses suffered by [[19th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|19. PzDiv]] (not subordinate to Bach), briefly engaged against the Poles in Northern Warsaw during last days of the fightings.

Until the late 20th century the 17,000 figure was consistently and unequivocally quoted in the Polish, though also in the East German and Soviet historiography, be it encyclopedias,&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Kazimierz Sobczak (ed.), ''Encyklopedia II wojny światowej'', Warszawa 1975, p. 626&lt;/ref&gt; scientific monographs&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Jerzy Kirchmayer, ''Powstanie Warszawskie, Warszawa 1978'', ISBN  {{ISBN|830511080X}}, p. 576&lt;/ref&gt; or more popular works.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Władysław Bartoszewski, ''1859 dni Warszawy'', Warszawa 1982, {{ISBN|8370061524}}, p. 758&lt;/ref&gt; It was at times paired or otherwise related to the figure of 16,000 German Warsaw KIA+MIA listed by the so-called ''Gehlen report'' of April 1945.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Krzysztof Komorowski, ''Militarne aspekty powstania warszawskiego'', [in:] Marek M. Drozdowski (ed.), ''Powstanie Warszawskie z perspektywy półwiecza'', Warszawa 1995, {{ISBN|8386301104}}, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; The 2,000 figure was accepted in West Germany and generally spilled over to Western historiography;&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Gunther Deschner, ''Warsaw rising'', New York 1972, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; exceptions were studies written in English by the Poles&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Janusz Kazimierz Zawodny, ''Nothing But Honour: The Story of the Warsaw Uprising'', 1944, Washington 1978, {{ISBN|9780817968311}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some other works.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the US Congress'', Washington 1983, p. 16309&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently the Polish historiography has been increasingly turning towards the 2,000 figure. Komorowski, who in 1995 opted for 16,000, changed his mind and 10 years later cautiously subscribed to the 2,000 figure;&lt;ref&gt;Krzysztof Komorowski, ''Bitwa o Warszawę ’44'', Warszawa 2004, {{ISBN|9788373991330}}, p.  271&lt;/ref&gt; also scholars like Sawicki&lt;ref&gt;Tadeusz Sawicki, ''Rozkaz: zdławić Powstanie'', Warszwa 2001, {{ISBN|9788311092846}}, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; and Rozwadowski&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Rozwadowski, ''Warszawa 1944-1945'', Warszawa 2006, {{ISBN|8311104808}}, pp. 110-111&lt;/ref&gt; tentatively followed suit. The discrepancy is tackled head-on in a popular work of Bączyk,&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Bączyk, ''Ilu naprawdę poległo w powstaniu warszawskim'', [in:] ''Tygodnik Polityka'' 42 (2014), pp. 54-56&lt;/ref&gt; who concludes that 3,000 is the maximum conceivable (though not the most probable) figure. In his 2016 analysis Sowa dismissed the 17,000 figure as “entirely improbable” and suggested that its longevity and popularity resulted from manipulation on part of apologists of the Rising.&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Leon Sowa, ''Kto wydał wyrok na miasto?'', Kraków 2016, {{ISBN|9788308060957}}, pp. 617-618. The claim should be taken with caution; the 17,000 figure was systematically reproduced also in the Communist propaganda, which first lambasted the Rising as criminal suicidal act and later approached it at least with great deal of skepticism&lt;/ref&gt;  In popular discourse in Poland the 17,000 figure still remains in wide circulation.&lt;ref&gt;it is advanced e.g. by ''Dzieje.pl'', a website operated by a number of official Polish institutions, compare [http://dzieje.pl/infografiki/polskie-i-niemieckie-straty-w-powstaniu-warszawskim here]&lt;/ref&gt; Popular media seem bewildered; the most popular Polish internet portal ''[[Onet.pl|Onet]]'' in its news section favors the 2,000 figure&lt;ref&gt;compare the ''Onet'' news section, available [http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/powstanie-warszawskie-ile-trwalo-data-mapa-skutki-infografika/s7n9s1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in its educational section opts for 17,000.&lt;ref&gt;compare the ''Onet'' educational service, available [http://klasowka.onet.pl/podrecznik/poznac-przeszlosc-wiek-xx-klasa-1-liceum/podrozdzial-rozdzial-iv-powstanie-warszawskie/wytlumaczenie here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond Poland and Germany both figures remain in circulation, though the ones of 16-17,000 seem to be on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. a booklet from the popular Osprey series, which claims 16,000 German KIA, Robert Forczyk, ''Warsaw 1944'', Bloomsbury 2009, {{ISBN|9781846033520}}, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In the Russian historiography it is given clear preference, be it in encyclopedias and dictionaries&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. the entry ''Армия Крайова'', [in:] Андрей Голубев, Дмитрий Лобанов, ''Великая Отечественная война 1941–1945 гг. Энциклопедический словарь'', Москва 2017, {{ISBN|9785040341412}}&lt;/ref&gt; or general works;&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Андрей Паршев, Виктор Степаков, ''Не там и не тогда. Когда началась и где закончилась Вторая мировая?'', Москва 2017, {{ISBN|9785457906037}}, p. 437&lt;/ref&gt; the same opinion might be found in Belorussia.&lt;ref&gt;''Беларуская энцыклапедыя'', vol. 4, Мінск 1997, {{ISBN|9789851100909}}, p. 17. The entry claims that total losses suffered by the Germans when fighting the Poles and stated as 26,000 were recorded by the 9th Army&lt;/ref&gt; The 17,000 estimate made it also to the English literature, quoted with no reservations in popular compendia,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Crawford, ''The Eastern Front Day by Day; 1941-1945. A Photographic Chronology'', New York 2012, {{ISBN|9781908410245}} (referred after the Russian translation {{ISBN|9785457409637}}, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;  warfare manuals&lt;ref&gt;Milan N. Vego, ''Joint Operational Warfare: Theory and Practice'', Tampa 2009, {{ISBN|9781884733628}}, p. II-36)&lt;/ref&gt; and a handful of other works.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Cooke, [[Ben H. Shepherd]] (eds.), ''Hitler's Europe Ablaze: Occupation, Resistance, and Rebellion during World War II'', New York 2014, {{ISBN|9781632201591}}, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; The figure is advanced also by established institutions like BBC.&lt;ref&gt;compare ''August 1'' entry [in:] BBC ''On This Day'' service, available [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/1/newsid_3932000/3932555.stm here]&lt;/ref&gt; Other works in English offer a number of approaches; some quote both sides with no own preference,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony James Joes, ''Resisting Rebellion: The History and Politics of Counterinsurgency'', Lexington 2006, {{ISBN|9780813191706}}, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; some provide ambiguous descriptions,&lt;ref&gt;"German casualties totalled over 17,000 soldiers", Zuzanna Bogumił, Joanna Wawrzyniak, Tim Buchen, Christian Ganzer, ''The Enemy on Display: The Second World War in Eastern European Museums'', New York 2015, {{ISBN|9781782382188}}, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; some set 17,000 irrecoverable losses as an upper limit,&lt;ref&gt;"German losses may have been as high as 17,000 dead and missing", Alan Axelrod, Jack A. Kingston, ''Encyclopedia of World War II'', vol. 1, New York 2007, {{ISBN|9780816060221}}, p. 872&lt;/ref&gt;  some provide odd numbers perhaps resulting from incompetent quotations&lt;ref&gt;"German losses amounted to some 10,000 dead 9,000 wounded", Stephan Lehnstaedt, ''Occupation in the East: The Daily Lives of German Occupiers in Warsaw and Minsk, 1939-1944'', New York 2016, {{ISBN|9781785333248}}, p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;  and some remain silent on the issue altogether, which is the case of the only major English monograph.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''Rising 44'', London 2003, {{ISBN|9780333905685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among amateur historians the issue keeps generating some interest; discussions on various internet platforms tend to favor the 2,000 figure, be it on English-language fora,&lt;ref&gt;see ''feldgrau'' forum, available [https://www.feldgrau.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1182 here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929111256/https://www.feldgrau.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1182 |date=29 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish ones&lt;ref&gt;see ''Forum Powstania Warszawskiego'', available [https://archive.li/20070103010259/http://forum.1944.pl/index.php?showtopic=637 here]&lt;/ref&gt; or those in German.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Forum der Wehrmacht'', available [http://www.forum-der-wehrmacht.de/index.php/Thread/27880-Kampfgruppe-von-dem-Bach/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; The 17,000 figure is doubted or dismissed on basis of comparative data or various extrapolations;&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. comparison with German casualties suffered during similar urban battles like Budapest or Breslau, combatant v. casualty ratio during the Rising, some detailed German daily or unit casualty reports from the Rising, overall German losses sustained in Europe during August and September, analysis of some daily averages and other&lt;/ref&gt; figures provided by Gehlen in 1945 are deemed to refer to the overall German losses in and around Warsaw, also against the Soviets. A key argument supporting the 17,000 figure – apart from quotations from Bach and Gehlen - are total (KIA+MIA+WIA) losses sustained by Kampfgruppe Dirlewanger, one of a few operational units forming German troops fighting the Poles. They are currently calculated at some 3,500;&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Michaelis, ''Das SS-Sonderkommando "Dirlewanger": Der Einsatz in Weißrussland 1941-1944'', Dusseldorf 2012, {{ISBN|9783895557644}}. The author does not provide explicit Dirlewanger’s losses sustained when in combat against the Poles, yet his various detailed and general figures scattered across the book suggest an estimate ranging from 3,280 to 3,770&lt;/ref&gt; if extrapolated, they might support the overall 25,000 German casualty estimate.

The facts of the Warsaw Uprising were inconvenient to Stalin, and were twisted by propaganda of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], which stressed the failings of the Home Army and the Polish government-in-exile, and forbade all criticism of the Red Army or the political goals of Soviet strategy.&lt;ref name="Sawicki"/&gt; In the immediate post-war period, the very name of the Home Army was censored, and most films and novels covering the 1944 Uprising were either banned or modified so that the name of the Home Army did not appear.&lt;ref name="Sawicki"/&gt; From the 1950s on, Polish propaganda depicted the soldiers of the Uprising as brave, but the officers as treacherous, reactionary and characterized by disregard of the losses.&lt;ref name="Sawicki"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 521–522.&lt;/ref&gt; The first publications on the topic taken seriously in the West were not issued until the late 1980s. In Warsaw no monument to the Home Army was built until 1989. Instead, efforts of the Soviet-backed [[Armia Ludowa|People's Army]] were glorified and exaggerated.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

By contrast, in the West the story of the Polish fight for Warsaw was told as a tale of valiant heroes fighting against a cruel and ruthless enemy. It was suggested that Stalin benefited from Soviet non-involvement, as opposition to eventual Soviet control of Poland was effectively eliminated when the Nazis destroyed the partisans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Arnold-Forster|Arnold-Forster, Mark]] (1973; repr. 1983). ''[[The World at War]]''. London: Collins/Thames Television repr. Thames Methuen. {{ISBN|0-423-00680-0}}. pp. 179–180.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that the Uprising failed because of deliberate procrastination by the Soviet Union contributed to anti-Soviet sentiment in Poland. Memories of the Uprising helped to inspire the Polish labour movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], which led a peaceful opposition movement against the Communist government during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 601–602.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1990s, historical analysis of the events remained superficial because of official censorship and lack of academic interest.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Research into the Warsaw Uprising was boosted by the [[revolutions of 1989]], due to the abolition of censorship and increased access to state archives. {{As of|2004}}, however, access to some material in British, Polish and ex-Soviet archives was still restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Further complicating the matter is the British claim that the records of the Polish government-in-exile were destroyed,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 528.&lt;/ref&gt; and material not transferred to British authorities after the war was burnt by the Poles in London in July 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Alfred Peszke|Peszke, Michael Alfred]] (October 2006).

In Poland, 1 August is now a celebrated anniversary. On 1 August 1994, Poland held a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Uprising to which both the German and Russian presidents were invited.&lt;ref name="sb"/&gt; Though the German President [[Roman Herzog]] attended, the Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] declined the invitation; other notable guests included the U.S. Vice President [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref name=sb/&gt;&lt;ref name="wvoice"/&gt; Herzog, on behalf of Germany, was the first German statesman to apologize for German atrocities committed against the Polish nation during the Uprising.&lt;ref name=wvoice/&gt; During the 60th anniversary of the Uprising in 2004, official delegations included: German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]], UK deputy Prime Minister [[John Prescott]] and US Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]]; [[Pope John Paul II]] sent a letter to the mayor of Warsaw, [[Lech Kaczyński]] on this occasion.&lt;ref name="60an"/&gt; Russia once again did not send a representative.&lt;ref name=60an/&gt; A day before, 31 July 2004, the [[Warsaw Uprising Museum]] opened in Warsaw.&lt;ref name=60an/&gt;

At present, Poland largely lacks a critical view of the leaders of the 1944 Warsaw uprising. The reasons for the defeat of the uprising are mainly seen in external factors, the lack of sufficient support from the USSR and to a lesser extent from the United States and great Britain. The poor relations between modern Russia and Poland in this case are an additional argument for such views. Meanwhile, in Poland, there is a different view of the Warsaw uprising, presented, for example, in 1974 by Jan. M. Ciechanowski, the historian and participant of the Warsaw uprising. His views were already widely spread in the 1970s, although he was not a Communist historian. In this view, the Warsaw uprising is seen as a manifestation of a long-standing historical tradition of Poland in the form of anti-Russian discourse using an external factor in this discourse. From this point of view, the Warsaw uprising was most directed against Russia-USSR and was designed to create a confrontation between the United States-Britain and the USSR. 
'By undertaking the struggle against the Germans', said Gen Pelczynski in 1965, 'the Home Army was defending the independence of Poland threatened by the Russians. . . If the Russians were our allies there would not have been so great an insurrection.. .'* To its authors the insurrection was 'a form of political struggle against the entering Muscovites... (Muscovites - a pejorative name for Russians in Poland)... Jankowski and Bor-Komorowski hoped that a strong, resolute and unconciliatory attitude to the Russians would produce more fruitful results. They believed that only by assuming an intransigent attitude to Stalin and by confronting him as the leaders of insurgent Warsaw would they be able to compel him to treat them as equals and allow them to govern the country after liberation. In their view, the adoption of any less robust course of action would amount to political suicide. The insurrection was to be their moment of triumph; in the event, it was precisely the absence of military co-operation between the Polish and Russian forces which turned it, instead, into a time of defeat and destruction".&lt;ref&gt;Jan. M. Ciechanowski. The Warsaw Rising of 1944.  Cambridge University Press. Cambridge. London. 1974. p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

Piotr Zychowicz caused a storm of outrage in with his book The Madness of ’44 for calling the Uprising “a gigantic, useless sacrifice.” Zychowicz criticized the leadership of the Home Army for an exercise of poor judgment that led to the death of thousands of people.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalia Romaniec, “The Wounds of Warsaw,” Deutsche Welle, Aug. 1, 2014. https://www.dw.com/en/the-wounds-of-warsaw/a-17826319&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known Polish publicist and philosopher, Bronislaw Lagowski, in one of his interviews called the approach in which the Warsaw uprising is considered a "moral victory" and is associated with the democratization of Polish society, absurd. According to him, " the cult of an event that caused huge losses, especially a cult that is not sad, but joyful-it is so disconnected from life that we can talk about a painful state [of minds]

Recently, the attitude towards the Warsaw events has begun to change in Poland. According to Piskorsky (Director of the European center for geopolitical analysis in Warsaw), this was a reaction to the way right-wing politicians used the symbolism associated with the uprising for their purely practical purposes.

According to Radziwinowicz (chief correspondent Bureau of "Gazeta Wyborcza" in Moscow), now part of Polish society is beginning to rethink much of what concerns the Warsaw uprising.

"This is a reflection on the terrible tragedy of the people. Suddenly, at the very end of the war, when it seemed that everything was already over, the city is dying, the capital is dying, 200 thousand people are dying, " says a Polish journalist.

"I myself was brought up on the tradition of the Warsaw uprising, and it was something sacred for me for a long time. There was heroism, tragedy. However, now is the time to ask questions: who is to blame and whether it was necessary to start the uprising at all?", - said Radzivinovich.&lt;ref&gt;Alexey Timofeyev. BBC, Moscow. July 31, 2012. Poles rethink the Warsaw uprising. https://www.bbc.com/russian/russia/2012/07/120731_warsaw_uprising.shtml#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture: music, television and cinema==
Numerous works have been influenced by and devoted to the Uprising. In literature, they include: ''Kolumbowie. Rocznik 20'' novel by Polish writer Roman Bratny.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In television, they include documentary film ''The Ramparts of Warsaw 1943–44'', produced for the 70th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising with support from the European Commission. The Warsaw Uprising is often confused with the revolt in the Warsaw Ghetto which took place a year earlier in the Spring of 1943. Three young Europeans, Alexandra (France), Maria (Poland) and Roman (Germany) meet in Warsaw to enquire into these events; here they meet witnesses who took part in the Warsaw Uprising or lived in the ghetto. Beneath their white hair we can recognise the men and women who formed the living ramparts of freedom in the face of Nazism. Meanwhile, the Polish World War II TV drama series ''[[Czas honoru|Time Of Honor]]'' (''Czas honoru''; Series 7), which aired in 2014, was entirely devoted to the Warsaw Uprising.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In cinema, they include:
*''[[Kanał]]'', a 1956 Polish film directed by [[Andrzej Wajda]]. It was the first film made about the Warsaw Uprising, telling the story of a company of Home Army resistance fighters escaping the Nazi onslaught through the city's sewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050585/|title=Kanal|author=|date=|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 2014 film, ''Warsaw Uprising'', directed by Jan Komasa and produced by the Warsaw Uprising Museum, was created entirely from restored and colourised film footage taken during the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/movies/warsaw-uprising-animates-archival-footage.html|title=‘Warsaw Uprising’ Animates Archival Footage|first=Nicolas|last=Rapold|date=6 November 2014|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Komasa followed this up with ''[[Warsaw 44]]'' (also known as ''Miasto 44'', "City 44"), a story of love, friendship and the pursuit of adventure during the bloody and brutal reality of the uprising, which was a huge box office success in Poland in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3737878/|title=Powstanie Warszawskie|author=|date=|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Roman Polanski]]'s film [[The Pianist (2002 film)|''The Pianist'']] also briefly shows the uprising through the eyes of its main character [[Władysław Szpilman]]. Polish director Małgorzata Brama stated he intends to shoot a docudrama about the Warsaw Uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warsaw Uprising Docudrama to Begin Filming|url=http://www.filmneweurope.com/news/poland/105417-production-warsaw-uprising-docudrama-to-begin-filming/menu-id-158|access-date=24 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520163245/http://www.filmneweurope.com/news/poland/105417-production-warsaw-uprising-docudrama-to-begin-filming/menu-id-158|archive-date=20 May 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Niki Caro]]'s 2017 film [[The Zookeeper's Wife (film)|''The Zookeeper's Wife'']] depicts the Warsaw Uprising and [[Jan Żabiński]]'s participation in it. At the end of the film, the viewer is informed that Warsaw was destroyed during the war and that only six percent of the Polish capital's prewar population was still in the city after the uprising.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
*The second film of [[Yuri Ozerov (director)|Yuri Ozerov]]'s epic ''Soldiers of Freedom'' of 1977 is mostly devoted to the uprising in Warsaw. The presentation of historical events is given from the Soviet point of view.

Swedish power metal group [[Sabaton (band)|Sabaton]] made a song about the event, titled "Uprising".
