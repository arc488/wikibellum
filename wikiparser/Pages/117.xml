The '''Battle of Ancona''' was a battle involving forces from [[Poland]] serving as part of the [[British Army]] and [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces that took place from 16 June–18 July 1944 during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]] in [[World War II]]. The battle was the result of an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] plan to capture the city of [[Ancona]] in Italy in order to gain possession of a [[seaport]] closer to the fighting so that they could shorten their [[lines of communication]]. The [[Polish 2nd Corps]] was tasked with capture of the city on 16 June 1944, accomplishing the task a month later on 18 July 1944.

==Background==
The [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] advance north meant that the logistics line was in need of a port closer to the front lines than the ports of [[Pescara]] and [[Anzio]].&lt;ref name=Wawer4&gt;Zbigniew Wawer, ''Zdobycie Bolonii'', p.4&lt;/ref&gt; As such, two new targets were designated: [[Ancona]] on the [[Adriatic]] coast, and [[Livorno]] on the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]].&lt;ref name=Wawer4/&gt; On 16 June, [[II Corps (Poland)|Polish II Corps]] under [[Lieutenant general|Lieutenant-General]] [[Władysław Anders]]—which had been taken into [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], commanded by [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Oliver Leese|Sir Oliver Leese]], reserve after its efforts in the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]]—was brought forward once more to relieve [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|British V Corps]] and tasked with the capture of Ancona. On 17 June, Anders was given command of the Adriatic sector of the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian theatre]].&lt;ref name=Wawer4/&gt;

The first obstacle to cross was the [[Chienti]] river. Polish troops reached it on 21 June, and heavy fighting lasted in that region until 30 June.&lt;ref name=Wawer4/&gt; The main offensive on Ancona began on 17 July.&lt;ref name=Wawer4/&gt; Polish armored troops took [[Monte della Crescia]] and outflanked German troops defending Ancona.&lt;ref name=Wawer4/&gt; Next, Polish troops secured [[Casenuove]], and neighbouring British and Canadian troops took [[Montecchio]] and [[Croce di San Vincenzo]].&lt;ref name=Wawer4/&gt; By the evening of 17 July, Polish troops were near [[Agugliano]], and the following morning they took [[Offagna]].&lt;ref name=Wawer4/&gt; Later that day, Polish troops took [[Chiaravalle, Italy|Chiaravalle]], and armored troops reached the sea, cutting the German defenders of Ancona from the north-west.&lt;ref name=Wawer4/&gt; The Germans were falling back towards the sea, and Polish troops encountered little resistance entering Ancona at 14:30 on 18 July.&lt;ref name=Wawer4/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Taking Ancona was the only independent operation of the Polish II Corps.&lt;ref name=Wawer4/&gt; Afterward, the Corps took part in the breaking of the [[Gothic Line]] and the Allied [[Spring 1945 offensive in Italy|spring 1945 offensive]] which resulted in the surrender of the Axis forces in Italy.

For their action in the battle while seconded to the Polish corps, the British [[7th Queen's Own Hussars]] received the battle honour "Ancona".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.qohmuseum.org.uk/maid.htm |title=Maid of Warsaw&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=8 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012215137/http://www.qohmuseum.org.uk/maid.htm |archive-date=12 October 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
