The '''Silesian Offensives''' were two separate offensives conducted in February and March 1945 by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] against the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in [[World War II]] to protect the flanks of the Red Army during its push to Berlin to prevent a German counterattack.  It delayed the final push toward Berlin by 2 months.

==The offensives==
The [[Lower Silesian Offensive]] ran from 8–24 February 1945, and the [[Upper Silesian Offensive]] from 15–31 March. Designed to flank the Soviet main advance on [[Berlin]], the two operations pushed the ''Wehrmacht'' out of [[Silesia]].

According to Soviet information, the Germans lost 54,000 soldiers: 40,000 dead and 14,000 captured in the Upper Silesian Offensive.&lt;ref&gt;http://militarymaps.narod.ru/oper_1945.html#13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1st Ukrainian Front]] under [[Ivan Konev]]’s command—having completed the [[Vistula–Oder Offensive]]—was to advance westward toward Silesia with the primary objective of protecting the left flank of the [[1st Belorussian Front]], which was pushing toward [[Berlin]]. Similarly, the [[East Pomeranian Offensive]] of the [[2nd Belorussian Front]] in the north was tasked with protecting the 1st Belorussian Front's right flank.

==Delay==
The need to secure the flanks delayed till April the Soviets' final [[Battle of Berlin|push toward Berlin]], which had originally been planned for February. By mid-April, the East Pomeranian Offensive—carried out by the 2nd, and elements of the 1st, Belorussian Fronts—had succeeded in its objectives, reaching the important German port city of [[Szczecin|Stettin]] (now Szczecin).

==Motives==
[[Joseph Stalin]]'s decision to delay the push toward Berlin from February to April 1945 has been a subject of controversy among Soviet generals and military historians, with one side arguing that in February the Soviets had a chance of securing Berlin much faster and with far fewer losses, and the other arguing that the possibility of large German formations (remnants of the [[Czechoslovak border fortifications|Czech fortification]] system) remaining on the flanks could have resulted in a successful German counterattack and further prolonged the war. Stalin's aim in delaying the advance on Berlin had likely been political, as it allowed him to occupy substantial parts of [[Austria]] in the [[Vienna Offensive]].
