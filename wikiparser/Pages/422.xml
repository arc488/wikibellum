'''Operation Spring Awakening''' (''Unternehmen Frühlingserwachen'') (planned for 5 – 15 March 1945) was the last major German offensive of [[World War II]]. It took place in Western [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. This offensive was referred to in Germany as the '''Plattensee Offensive''' and in the Soviet Union as the '''Balaton Defensive Operation''' (6 – 15 March 1945).

The offensive began in great secrecy on 6 March 1945 with an offensive near [[Lake Balaton]], an area with the last significant oil reserves still available to the [[Axis powers]]. The operation involved many German units withdrawn from the [[Battle of the Bulge|failed Ardennes Offensive]] on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]], including the [[6th Panzer Army]] and its subordinate [[Waffen-SS]] divisions. The operation was a failure for Nazi Germany.

== Background ==
On January 12, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] received confirmation that the Soviet Red Army had begun a massive winter offensive through Poland named the [[Vistula–Oder Offensive|Vistula-Oder Offensive.]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hitler’s Last Offensive: Operation Spring Awakening|url=https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/2016/10/31/hitlers-last-offensive-operation-spring-awakening/|date=2016-10-31|website=Warfare History Network|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler ordered [[OB West]] Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt|Gerd Von Rundstedt]] to withdraw the following units from active combat in the [[Battle of the Bulge]]: [[I SS Panzer Corps|I SS Panzer Coprs]] with [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte]] and [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]], along with [[II SS Panzer Corps]] with [[2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich]] and [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen]].&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; These units were to be refitted by January 30 and attached to the [[6th Panzer Army]] under the command of [[Sepp Dietrich]] for the upcoming Operation Spring Awakening. Hitler wanted to secure the extremely vital [[Nagykanizsa]] oil fields of southern Hungary, as this was the most strategically valuable asset remaining on the Eastern Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Duffy|first=Christopher|title=Red Storm on the Reich: The Soviet March on Germany, 1945|publisher=Castle Books|year=|isbn=0-7858-1624-0|location=Edison, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deadline of January 30 proved impossible for refitting to be completed.

As Operation Spring Awakening would be of great importance, lengthy preparation and strategic care was taken so as to not reveal the offensive. But while the [[6th Panzer Army]] was refitting in Germany, Hitler ordered a preliminary offensive with a similar object to be conducted,&lt;ref name="hitlers-last-offensive" /&gt; resulting in [[Operation Konrad III]] beginning January 18. The objectives of Konrad III included relieving besieged [[Budapest]] and the recapturing of the [[Transdanubia]] region. By January 21, only 5 days into Operation Konrad III, the Germans had taken the towns of [[Dunaújváros|Dunapentle]] and [[Adony]] which reside on the Western shore of the [[Danube]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Kard a Pajzs Mögött - A "Konrád" hadműveletek története,1945 2.bővített kiadás|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-963-89623-7-9|location=Budapest|pages=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their push resulted in the annihilation of the Soviet [[7th Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|7th Mechanized Corps]]. This sudden and savage push caused the Soviet command to actually contemplate an evacuation to the opposite shore.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By this time the Germans had recaptured 400 square kilometers of territory, an achievement comparable to the initial German gains during the [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes Offensive]] and the Western Front in December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Frieser|first=Karl-Heinz|title=The Eastern Front 1943–1944: The War in the East and on the Neighbouring Fronts.

From January 27 through February 15, the Soviets conducted numerous successful counter-attacks, forcing the German's to give up the greater portion of their territorial gains, pushing the front line back to the area between [[Lake Velence]], the village of [[Csősz]], and [[Lake Balaton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Kard a Pajzs Mögött - A „Konrád” hadműveletek története, 1945 2.bővített kiadás|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-963-89623-7-9|location=Budapest|pages=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area had the Margit Line running right through it, and would see more fighting in the upcoming Operation Spring Awakening.

This bridgehead would jeopardize the upcoming Spring Awakening's South-Eastern push past Lake Balaton to secure the southern Hungarian oilfields while also exposing a straight route towards [[Vienna]]. Thus beginning on February 17, [[Operation Southwind]] began the effort to secure the Garam (S:[[Hron]]) bridgehead from the [[2nd Ukrainian Front]], and by February 24 the task was successfully achieved, proving to be one of the very last successful German offensives of the war.

===== Creation of Operation Spring Awakening =====
During a Situation Conference on January 7, 1945 at which both [[Hermann Göring]] and [[OB West]] Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] were present, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] proposed his intention of pulling the [[6th SS Panzer Army]] to form a reserve due to severe Allied air attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-921991-78-9|location=Canada|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Rundstedt received the withdrawal orders on January 8, and the Panzer Army's divisions began preparations to withdraw from the Front.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The slow withdrawal which was greatly hampered by Allied air superiority.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-921991-78-9|location=Canada|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 12, the Soviet [[1st Ukrainian Front|1st Ukrainian]] and [[1st Belorussian Front]]s began their [[Vistula–Oder Offensive|Vistula-Oder Offensive]] with over 2 million men&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Vistula–Oder Offensive|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vistula%E2%80%93Oder_Offensive|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=18 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Circular reference|date=May 2020}} placing considerable new pressure on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. When this news reached Hitler, he immediately began to plan a major offensive on this Front. Meanwhile, during January 14 on the Western Front, the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer divisions had to be recommitted back from reserves due to successful allied fighting.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On January 20, Hitler ordered Gerd Von Rundstedt to withdraw forces from the ongoing [[Battle of the Bulge]]; the 1st SS, 2nd SS and 12th SS Divisions managed to disengage and withdraw the same day.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-921991-78-9|location=Canada|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all support units of the 6th SS Panzer Army were pulled from the [[Ardennes]] by January 22, while the 9th SS Panzer Division was the last to leave on January 23.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

On this same day, January 22, Hitler decided that the 6th SS Panzer Army should not be sent back to the Western Front, but rather to Hungary, a view [[Heinz Guderian]] ([[Oberkommando des Heeres|OKH]]) partially agreed on; Guderian wanted the 6th SS Panzer Army on the Eastern Front, but there to mainly protect Berlin.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; A glimpse of the ensuing verbal exchange during this argument was captured in [[Alfred Jodl]]'s ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]]) post-war interrogation where he states Hitler said: "''You want to attack without oil- good, we'll see what happens when you attempt that''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-921991-78-9|location=Canada|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, main reason for sending the 6th SS Panzer Army south into Hungary can be understood through the list of main strategic points listed in a Situation in the East conference held on January 23: 1) The Hungarian oil region and Vienna oil region which made up 80% of reserves, without which the war effort could not be continued, 2) the [[Gdańsk|Danzig estuary]] vital for [[U-boat]] operations and [[Province of Upper Silesia|Upper Silesian]] industrial region for the war economy and coal production.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; These two quotes illustrate how seriously Hitler viewed his ruling: “''Hitler considered the protection of Vienna and Austria as of vital importance and that he would rather see Berlin fall than lose the Hungarian oil area and Austria''”,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Warlimont|first=Walter|title=Inside Hitler's Headquarters|publisher=|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=499}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''He'' [Hitler] ''accepted the risk of the Russian threat to the Oder east of Berlin''".&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

On January 27, Heinz Guderian was tasked by Hitler to stop the [[3rd Ukrainian Front]] in the vicinity on the Margit-Line in order to protect the vital oil fields.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán.|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=Budapest|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, January 28, this operation received its preliminary name, Operation Süd (G:South).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The main objectives of the operation were as follows: 1) the security of vital raw materials such as oil, bauxite, and manganese for iron, 2) arable land for food and crops, the Austrian military industrial complex, and the city of [[Vienna]], 3) to stop the Soviet Advance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Interestingly, an additional side-objective was the hope that serious pressure on the Southern Soviet Fronts in Hungary would force the Soviet Command to divert some forces from its Northern Offensives headed to [[Berlin]] towards Hungary.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Operation Süd was scheduled to start after a path to [[Budapest]] had been established.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The operation was considered to be a success if 1) [[Operation Konrad III]] could pin the Soviets between the [[Vértes Mountains|Vértes mountains]] and the [[Danube]], 2) the [[8th Army (Wehrmacht)|8th Army]] could secure its Front in Northern Hungary, 3) if the incoming panzer armies could be refitted during transit to create the advantage of surprise.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Four plans for Operation Süd were produced by high-ranking officials from [[Army Group South]], [[6th SS Panzer Army]], and the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]]. “Lösung A” by [[Fritz Kraemer (Waffen-SS)|Fritz Krämer]] of 6th SS Panzer Army, “Lösung B” and “Lösung C2” by Helmuth Von Grolman of Army Group South, and “Lösung C1” by [[Heinrich Gaedcke]] of 6th Army with much fighting and bickering as to which plan should be implemented.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=Budapest|pages=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army Group South commander [[Otto Wöhler]] chose “Lösung B”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The four plans were sent to Heinz Guderian on February 22 for review, and Army Group South informed [[Army Group F]] commander [[Maximilian von Weichs]] on February 23 that the operation would commence on March 5, in anticipation that [[Operation Southwind|Operation Südwind]] (G:Southwind) will have successfully finished by February 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=Budapest|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; If [[Operation Southwind]] was successful, Operation Süd's start could be deferred by 8–9 days.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; On February 25, Hitler ordered Otto Wöhler, Maximilian von Weichs, and [[Sepp Dietrich]] to personally present the plans for Operation Süd to him, along with Guderian ([[Oberkommando des Heeres|OKH]]) and [[Alfred Jodl]] ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]]),&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-921991-78-9|location=Canada|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Reich Chancellery]] in Berlin, where he ultimately chose “Lösung C2”.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=Budapest|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gudarian then ordered Otto Wöhler to increase the daily fuel allowance from 400 to 500 cubic meters (400k to 500k liters) of fuel on February 26,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=Budapest|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the February 28 the specifics of the now officially named “Operation Frühlingserwachen” (G:Spring Awakening) was completed.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; As per “Lösung C2” 3 offensive prongs were planned, with the main attack of the 6th Army and 6th SS Panzer Army “Frühlingserwachen” attacking towards the Danube through Lakes [[Lake Velence|Velence]] and [[Lake Balaton|Balaton]], the [[2nd Panzer Army]]’s “Eisbrecher” (G:Icebreaker) attacking Eastward from the Western end of Lake Balaton, and the [[LXXXXI Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|LXXXXI Corps]]'''’''' “Waldteufel” (G:Forest Devil) attacking North of the [[Drava|Drava River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=Budapest|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Overarching German military structure =====
The planning of Operation Spring Awakening is as interesting as the offensive itself, due to the chaotic nature of German military command this late in the war. [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]] (''Oberkommando der Wehrmacht)'' was the overarching military command for the German army in WW2, while the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|OKH]] (''Oberkommando des Heeres)'' was officially a high command operating under OKW. Adolf Hitler was the Commander-in-chief of OKH, while also being the supreme commander of OKW.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-921991-78-9|location=Canada|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding itself issuing more and more direct orders, OKW eventually became responsible for Western and Southern commands, while OKH was responsible for Eastern commands.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; This operational overlap caused by the centralized command led to disagreements, shortages, waste, inefficiencies, and delays, often escalating to the point where Hitler himself would have to give the final ruling on a matter.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

For Operation Spring Awakening, the area for the new offensive was set on the borderline between OKW ([[Army Group F]]) and OKH ([[Army Group South]]), and this would cause troubles.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; [[Army Group E]] wanted to assemble its troops north of the [[Drava|Drava River]] by February 25, but Army Group South was not prepared to start the offensive this early due to the ongoing [[Operation Southwind]]; subsequently the OKW and Hitler grew more impatient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-921991-78-9|location=Canada|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chosen course of action on February 25, "Lösung C2", favored the quicker and farther-reaching joint operation of the 2nd Panzer Army and 6th SS Panzer Army, while "Lösung B" opted to first secure the left flank of the main thrust "Frühlingserwachen" (between Lake Velence and the Danube) before moving south toward the 2nd Panzer army. Guderian was in favor of "Lösung C2" because this plan would shorten the time the 6th SS Panzer Division would need to stay in Hungary. The OKW and OKH did not use common terminology for parts of the offensive, as OKH referred to the entire offensive as Frühlingserwachen, while the OKW referred to the operation attacking north of the Drava as "Waldteufel".&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Army Group South and the OKH could not agree on how to best utilize the 1st Cavalry Corps. OKH wanted to send the Corps south-west to the 2nd Panzer army, a move Army Group South Commander Otto Wöhler saw of little use since the 2nd Panzer army would have a lower chance of success compared to the main attacking thrust of “Frühlingserwachen”. Wöhler wanted to use the 1st Cavalry Corps on the eastern shore of Lake Balaton, as German intelligence reported that "''the enemy is still the weakest between Lake Balaton and the [[Sárvíz (Sió)|Sárviz Channel]]''".&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

To further complicate matters, due to the limited number of newly trained personnel this late in the war, units under [[Waffen-SS]] command were often kept at acceptable capacity levels using [[Wehrmacht]] personnel. For instance, only 1/3 of the 6th SS Panzer Army's staff were actually from the Waffen-SS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=J.J.

===== Arrival into the Hungarian theater =====
When withdrawing from the Western Front, elements of the [[III. Flakkorps|III. Flak-Korps]] were tasked with protecting the 6th SS Panzer Army while en route to [[Zossen]] south of Berlin.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; From here the units' possible de-training locations would seem to be the cities along the [[Oder|Oder River]], however this was a calculated misinformation measure to confuse enemy forces who actually attacked these cities.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=J.J.

By February 7, on orders of Hitler, strict secrecy rulings were put into place: death penalty for command infractions, license plates were to be covered, insignia on vehicles and uniforms to be covered, no reconnaissance in forward combat areas, unit movements only by night or overcast conditions, no radio traffic, and the units were not to appear on situation maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|year=2004|isbn=0-921991-78-9|location=Canada|pages=419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, the start date for Operation Spring Awakening was finally moved back to March 6, though many commanders felt that a greater delay was necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-921991-78-9|location=Canada|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first days of March, alarming reports about road and terrain conditions due to the spring thaw flooded Army Group South Headquarters. Such thaws had previously badly affected 3 other operations in the area: planned Operation Spätlese in December, [[Operation Southwind]], and the “Waldteufel” attack forcing a change of location for the attack bridgehead from [[Osijek]] to [[Donji Miholjac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-921991-78-9|location=Canada|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the start of the operation being so close, some additional plans were thought up to help the sluggish assembly speeds of incoming units. On March 3, the 6th SS Panzer Army suggested that a naval assault across Lake Balaton itself could be implemented to help the 1st Cavalry Corps on the southeastern edge, but this turned out to be impossible as the spring storms had blown the [[Drift ice|pack ice]] against the southern shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-921991-78-9|location=Canada|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 5, the 6th SS Panzer Army took over command of the Hungarian II Corps, along with its 20th Hungarian Division and 9th replacement Division, hereby becoming responsible for the northern shore of Lake Balaton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-921991-78-9|location=Canada|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6th Panzer Army was responsible for the primary thrust of the offensive, “Frühlingserwachen”. It was to advance from an area north of Lake Balaton, through the two lakes (Balaton and Velence), and southeast to capture territory from the [[Sió|Sió Channel]] to the Danube. After reaching the Danube, one part of the army would turn north creating a northern spearhead and move along the Danube River to retake [[Budapest]], which had been captured on 13 February 1945. Another part of 6th SS Panzer Army would then turn south and create a southern spearhead. The southern spearhead would move along the [[Sió]] to link up with units from German [[Army Group E]], which was to thrust north through [[Mohács]]. However, the commanding staff of Army Group E was pessimistic about the LXXXXI Corps' ability to reach Mohács due to the unfavoring terrain and sole dependence on infantry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier, Georg (2004). Drama Between Budapest and Vienna: J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc. ISBN 0-921991-78-9.|first=Maier|title=Georg|publisher=J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-921991-78-9|location=Canada|pages=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, if successful, it was envisioned that the meeting of Army Group E's “Waldteufel” and the 6th SS Panzer Army's “Frühlingserwachen” would encircle both the Soviet [[26th Army (Soviet Union)|26th Army]] and the Soviet [[57th Army (Soviet Union)|57th Army]].&lt;ref name="Osprey" /&gt;

The [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]] would join the 6th SS Panzer Army in its thrust southeast to the Danube, then turn north to cover the flank of “Frühlingserwachen”. The [[2nd Panzer Army]]'s “Eisbrecher” would advance from an area southwest of Lake Balaton and progress towards [[Kaposvár]] to enguage the Soviet [[57th Army (Soviet Union)|57th Army]]. All this time, the [[Hungarian Third Army]] would hold the area west of Budapest along the [[Vértes Hills|Vértes Mountains]].&lt;ref name="Osprey" /&gt;

== Soviet preparation ==

===== Interrupted Soviet offensive preparations =====
On February 17 of 1945, the Soviet High Command ([[Stavka]]) instructed the [[2nd Ukrainian Front|2nd]] and [[3rd Ukrainian Front]]s to prepare for an offensive towards [[Vienna]] which would begin on March 15.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=Budapest|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, from February 17 to 18, the 2nd Ukrainian Front noticed the [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|1st SS Panzer division Leibstandarte]] and the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend|12th SS Panzer division Hitlerjugend]] fighting at the Garam River (S:[[Hron]]) during the German [[Operation Southwind]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Knowing that German [[Panzer division]]s were not created for defensive purposes, the Soviet Fronts in Hungary became suspicious of the enemy's intentions. Prisoners taken during Operation Southwind testified that the Germans were in fact preparing to gather a large offensive force.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By February 20, the Soviet fronts in Hungary began to understand what the Germans planned to do.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The security of the lands West of the [[Danube|River Danube]], particularly in the south which held the Hungarian oil fields, was the Germans' main priority at this stage of the war.

===== Soviet defensive preparations =====
As the 2nd Ukrainian Front held the territory of [[Budapest]] and the lands north of the Hungarian capital, defensive preparations in this sector were not paid much attention due to the lower likelihood of attack, but this was not the same in the south. 3rd Ukrainian Front marshal [[Fyodor Tolbukhin]] ordered his armies to prepare for a German offensive on his entire Front, preparation of which would have to be completed no latter then March 3.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=Budapest|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure sufficient supply of war materials and fuel, additional temporary bridges and gas pipelines were built on the Danube River.&lt;ref name="Osprey" /&gt;

Tolbukhin's plan was to initially slow down the German advance to rob their offensive of momentum, then begin grinding down the attacking armies, then initiate the planned Soviet offensive to finish off the remaining German forces.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This plan, along with the strategic deployment of the Soviet forces, was quite similar to that of the [[Battle of Kursk]], although it utilized experiences learned in 1943.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=Budapest|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3rd Ukrainian Front worked on digging in, creating extensive trench networks ideal for anti-tank defenses, along with defensive earthworks for the artillery and infantry.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The main differences between the Soviet defenses during the Battle of Kursk and the Balaton Defensive Operation (the Russian name for Operation Spring Awakening) was the relative short time frame allowed for defensive preparations (half a month), the smaller number of Soviet forces partaking in the defensive, and a reduced focus on perfecting the defensive lines as after all the 3rd Ukrainian Front would need to start its offensive from these lines.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Other minor differences included the lack or limited use of barbed wire installations, anti-tank obstacles, and bunkers,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; although the [[4th Guards Army]] command did suggest to place the burnt out wrecks of 38 previously destroyed German tanks into advantageous positions; it is unclear how many were actually set up.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Tolbukhin's 3rd Ukrainian Front had 5 Armies plus 1 Air Army, in addition it also had the [[First Army (Bulgaria)|1st Bulgarian Army]]&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=Budapest|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[3rd Army (Yugoslav Partisans)|3rd Yugoslav Partisan Army]] also partaking in the defense. The 3rd Ukrainian Front would be set up in a two echelon defensive layout, with the [[4th Guards Army]], [[26th Army (Soviet Union)|26th Army]], and [[57th Army (Soviet Union)|57th Army]], and the 1st Bulgarian Army in the first echelon, while the [[27th Army (Soviet Union)|27th Army]] would be held back in the second echelon for reserve.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The 4th Guards Army's three Guards Rifle Corps and one Guards Fortified District would be spread out over a 39&amp;nbsp;km front and reach 30&amp;nbsp;km deep, broken into two belts with one behind the other.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The 26th Army, which was expected to take the brunt of the German offensive, arranged its three Rifle Corps along a 44&amp;nbsp;km front but only 10–15&amp;nbsp;km deep.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 26th Army's Corps' would be layered in two belts whose defensive preparations had originally begun back on February 11,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; prior to any sign of German offensive intentions. The 57th Army's one Guards Rifle and one Rifle Corps were spread along a 60&amp;nbsp;km front and 10–15&amp;nbsp;km deep; the Army would receive another Rifle Corps during the fighting.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=Budapest|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 27th Army's one Guards Rifle and two Rifle Corps would remain in reserve unless the situation in the 26th Army called for its use.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Held in reserve, the 3rd Ukrainian Front also had the 18th Tank Corps and 23rd Tanks Corps, along with the [[1st Guards Mechanized Corps (Soviet Union)|1st Guards Mechanized Corps]] and the 5th Guards Cavalry Corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=Budapest|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these Armies were preparing for the immanent offensive, the [[17th Air Army]] was busy flying reconnaissance missions, although they could not report on much due to excellent German camouflage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=Budapest|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the serious tank losses of January–February along the Margit line, Marshal Tolbukhin ordered that no Front/Army level counter-attacks were to take place, and local tactical attacks should be very limited; the only objective was to hold the Front and grind down the German offensive.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The two tanks Corps would remain under the 26th and 27th Armies to be utilized only in dire need.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The defensive strategy of the 3rd Ukrainian Front was one of anti-tank defense as this was what the Germans were going to use. On average for every kilometer of Front, 700+ anti-tank and 600+ anti-infantry mines were placed, with these numbers rising to 2,700 and 2,900 respectively in the 26th Army's sector.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Számvéber|first=Norbert|title=Páncélosok a Dunantulon - Az Utolsó Páncélosütközetek Magyarországon 1945 Tavaszán|publisher=PeKo Publishing|year=2017|isbn=978-963-454-083-0|location=Budapest|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 4th Guards Army and 26th Guards Army, 66 anti-tank zones were created whose depth reached 30–35&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Each anti-tank position had 8-16 artillery guns and a similar number of anti-tank guns.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; A prime example of the scale of defensive installments can be seen in the 26th Army's 135th Rifle Corps. Between February 18 and March 3 the 233rd Rifle Division had dug 27 kilometers of trenches, 130 gun and mortar positions, 113 dugouts, 70 command posts and observation points, and laid 4,249 antitank and 5,058 antipersonnel mines, all this on a frontage of 5 kilometers. Although there were no tanks in this defensive zone, there was an average of 17 anti-tank guns per kilometer forming 23 tank killing grounds.&lt;ref name="hitlers-last-offensive"&gt;https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/wwii/hitlers-last-offensive-operation-spring-awakening/&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Overarching Soviet military structure =====
The Soviet Forces, contrary to the Germans, did not have such odd structural complications as the Soviet Armies could make independent decisions while the [[Stavka]] could intervene when asked or if necessary;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maier|first=Georg|title=Drama Between Budapest and Vienna|publisher=J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=0-921991-78-9|location=Canada|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; a much more straight forward military structure with clear boundaries. This is an example of a de-centralized command. It was not uncommon for the Soviets to actually search out and exploit the boundaries between the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]] and [[Oberkommando des Heeres|OKH]] as they knew these areas would suffer from poorer military command;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; the advance to Budapest is an example.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

The above table excludes units within the SS Panzer divisional structure which do not contain either tanks or self propelled guns.

Each German SS Panzer division would consist of a Panzer regiment, holding 2 Panzer battalions with 4 companies. While the 8 companies lay-out was standard, this could sometimes rise up to 10 companies depending on the circumstance; a company would have 16 tanks. The total number of tanks per SS Panzer regiment would total 128+ tanks.

The full combat strength of a SS Panzer division would include over 17,000 personnel and over 3,300 motorized vehicles.

The above table excludes units within the Panzer divisional structure which do not contain either tanks or self propelled guns.

Each German Panzer division would consist of a Panzer regiment, holding 2 Panzer battalions with 4 companies. While the 8 companies lay-out was standard, this could sometimes rise up to 10 companies depending on the circumstance; a company would have 13 tanks. The total number of tanks per Panzer regiment would total 100+ tanks.

The full combat strength of an Army Panzer division would include nearly 14,000 personnel and over 2,600 motorized vehicles

== German offensive ==
On the 6 March 1945, the German 6th Army, joined by the 6th SS Panzer Army launched a pincer movement north and south of [[Lake Balaton]]. Ten armoured (Panzer) and five infantry divisions, including a large number of new heavy [[Tiger II]] tanks, struck 3rd Ukrainian Front, hoping to reach the Danube and link up with the German 2nd Panzer Army forces attacking south of Lake Balaton.{{sfn|Glantz|House|1995|p=253}} The attack was spearheaded by the 6th SS Panzer Army and included elite units such as the [[1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler|LSSAH]] division. Dietrich's army made "good progress" at first, but as they drew near the Danube, the combination of the muddy terrain and strong Soviet resistance had ground the German advance to a halt.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=238}}

By the 14 March, Operation Spring Awakening was at risk of failure. The 6th SS Panzer Army was well short of its goals. The 2nd Panzer Army did not advance as far on the southern side of Lake Balaton as the 6th SS Panzer Army had on the northern side. Army Group E met fierce resistance from the [[Bulgarian First Army]] and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslavian partisan army]], and failed to reach its objective of [[Mohács]].

German losses were heavy. Heeresgruppe Süd lost 15,117 casualties in the first eight days of the offensive. The 6th Panzer Army and the 6th Army had only 332 tanks operational of the original approximately 1,000 operational at the start of the offensive.

On the 15 March, strength returns on this day show the [[9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] with 35 [[Panther tank]]s, 20 [[Panzer IV]]s, 32 [[Jagdpanzer]]s, 25 [[Sturmgeschütz]]es and 220 other self-propelled weapons and armoured cars. 42% of these vehicles were damaged, under short or long-term repair. The ''Das Reich'' Division had 27 Panthers, 22 Panzer IVs, 28 Jagdpanzers and 26 Sturmgeschützes on hand (the number of those under repair is not available).&lt;ref name="hitlers-last-offensive"/&gt;

== Soviet counterattack ==
[[File:Plattenseeoffensive.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Soviet counterattack]]
On 16 March, the Soviets forces counterattacked in strength. The Germans were driven back to the positions they had held before Operation Spring Awakening began.{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=182}} The overwhelming numerical superiority of the Red Army made any defense impossible, but Hitler believed victory was attainable.{{sfn|Ziemke|1968|p=450}}

On 22 March, the remnants of the 6th SS Panzer Army withdrew towards [[Vienna]]. By 30 March, the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front crossed from Hungary into Austria. By 4 April, the 6th SS Panzer Army was already in the Vienna area desperately setting up defensive lines against the anticipated Soviet [[Vienna Offensive]]. Approaching and encircling the Austrian capital were the Soviet [[4th Guards Tank Army|4th]] and 6th Guards Tank, [[9th Guards Army|9th Guards]], and 46th Armies.{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=182}}

The Soviet's Vienna Offensive ended with the fall of the city on 13 April. By 15 April, the remnants of the 6th SS Panzer Army were north of Vienna, facing the Soviet 9th Guards and 46th Armies. By 15 April, the depleted German 6th Army was north of [[Graz]], facing the Soviet 26th and 27th Armies. The remnants of the German 2nd Panzer Army were south of Graz in the [[Maribor]] area, facing the Soviet 57th Army and the Bulgarian First Army. Between 25 April and 4 May, the 2nd Panzer Army was attacked near [[Nagykanizsa]] during the [[Nagykanizsa–Körmend Offensive]].

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1986-064-10, Ungarn, Verwundetentransport.jpg|thumb|right|German casualties]]
Some Hungarian units survived the fall of Budapest and the destruction which followed when the Soviets counterattacked after Operation Spring Awakening. The Hungarian [[Szent László Infantry Division]] was still indicated to be attached to the German 2nd Panzer Army as late as 30 April. Between 16 and 25 March, the Hungarian Third Army had been destroyed about {{convert|40|km|mi}} west of Budapest by the Soviet 46th Army which was driving towards [[Bratislava]] and the Vienna area.

On 19 March, the Red Army recaptured the last territories lost during the 13‑day Axis offensive. Sepp Dietrich, commander of the Sixth SS Panzer Army tasked with defending the last sources of petroleum controlled by the Germans, joked that ''“6th Panzer Army is well named—we have just six tanks left.”''&lt;ref&gt;https://ww2days.com/germans-trapped-in-hungarian-capital-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of the operation resulted in the "armband order" that was issued to Sepp Dietrich by Adolf Hitler, who claimed that the troops, and more importantly, the ''Leibstandarte'', "did not fight as the situation demanded."{{sfn|Dollinger|1967|p=198}} As a mark of disgrace, the Waffen-SS units involved in the battle were ordered to remove their [[Uniforms of the German Army (1935–1945)|cuff title]]s. Dietrich did not relay the order to his troops.{{sfn|Stein|1984|p=238}}
