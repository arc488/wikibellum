The '''Courland Pocket'''&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-ru|блокада Курляндской группировки войск}} (Blockade of the Courland army group), ({{lang-de|Kurland-Kessel}})/{{lang-de|Kurland-Brückenkopf}} (Courland Bridgehead), {{lang-lv|Kurzemes katls}} (Courland Cauldron) or ''Kurzemes cietoksnis'' (Courland Fortress).&lt;/ref&gt; was a ln area of the [[Courland Peninsula]]  where a group of German forces of [[Reichskommissariat Ostland]] was cut off and surrounded by the [[Red Army]] from July 1944 through May 1945.

The pocket was created during the Red Army's [[Baltic Offensive]], when forces of the [[1st Baltic Front]] reached the [[Baltic Sea]] near [[Klaipėda|Memel]] during its lesser [[Memel Offensive Operation]] phases. This action isolated the German [[Army Group North]] from the rest of the German forces, having been pushed from the south by the Red Army, standing in a front between [[Tukums]] and [[Liepāja|Libau]] in [[Latvia]], with the [[Baltic Sea]] in the West, the [[Irbe Strait]] in the North and the [[Gulf of Riga]] in the East behind the Germans. Renamed [[Army Group Courland]] on 25 January, the Army Group in the Courland Pocket remained isolated until the end of the war. When they were ordered to surrender to the Soviet command on 8 May, they were in "blackout" and did not get the official order before 10 May, two days after the [[German Instrument of Surrender|capitulation]] of Germany. It was one of the last German groups to surrender in Europe.

==Background==
{{main|Operation Bagration}}
[[Courland]], along with the rest of the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] eastern coast and islands, was overrun by [[Army Group North]] during 1941. Army Group North spent most of the next two years attempting to take [[Leningrad]], without success. In January 1944, the Soviet Army lifted the [[siege of Leningrad]].

On 22 June 1944, the Red Army launched the Belorussian Strategic Offensive, codenamed [[Operation Bagration]]. The goal of this offensive was to liberate the [[Belorussian SSR]] from the [[Occupation of Belarus by Nazi Germany|German occupation]]. Operation Bagration was extremely successful, resulting in the almost complete destruction of [[Army Group Centre]], and ended on 29 August. In its final stages (the [[Kaunas Offensive|Kaunas]] and [[Šiauliai Offensive]]s), Operation Bagration saw Soviet forces strike deep towards the Baltic coast, severing communications between the German Army Group North and the remnants of Army Group Centre.

After Operation Bagration ended, the Soviet forces continued the clearing of the Baltic coast, despite German attempts to restore the front in [[Operation Doppelkopf]]. The Red Army fought the [[Battle of Memel|Memel Offensive Operation]] with the goal of isolating Army Group North by capturing the city of Memel ([[Klaipėda]]).

==Battles of the Courland Bridgehead==
[[File:1945-05-01GerWW2BattlefrontAtlas.jpg|thumb|Front lines 1 May 1945 (pink = allied occupied territory; red = area of fighting. The Courland Pocket can be seen on the upper right of this map, cut off from the general fighting in central Germany)]]

On 9 October 1944, the Soviet forces reached the [[Baltic Sea]] near Memel after over-running the headquarters of the [[3rd Panzer Army]]. As a result, Army Group North was cut off from [[East Prussia]]. Hitler's military advisors—notably [[Heinz Guderian]], the Chief of the [[German General Staff]]—urged evacuation and utilisation of the troops to stabilise the front in central Europe. However, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] refused, and ordered the German forces in Courland and the Estonian islands [[Hiiumaa]] and [[Saaremaa]] to hold out, believing them necessary to protect German submarine bases along the Baltic coast. Hitler still believed the war could be won, and hoped that Dönitz's new [[Type XXI submarine|Type XXI U-boat]] technology could bring victory to Germany in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], forcing the Allies out of Western Europe. This would allow German forces to focus on the Eastern Front, using the Courland Pocket as a springboard for a new offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gerhard L. |last=Weinberg |title=Germany, Hitler, and World War II: Essays in Modern German and World History |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge  |year=1995 |isbn=0-521-56626-6 |page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Kurland6pf20apr1945.jpg|thumb|upright|Stamp used in Courland pocket (1945)]]

Hitler's refusal to evacuate the Army Group resulted in the entrenchment of more than 200,000 German troops largely of the [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|16th Army]] and [[18th Army (Wehrmacht)|18th Army]], in what was to become known to the Germans as the "Courland Bridgehead". Thirty-three divisions of the Army Group North, commanded by Field-Marshall [[Ferdinand Schörner]], were cut off from [[East Prussia]] and spread out along a front reaching from [[Riga]] to [[Liepāja]], retreating to the more defensible Courland position, abandoning Riga.&lt;ref name=500Days&gt;{{cite book |last=McAteer |first=Sean |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bg8drRyDGhEC&amp;dq=McAteer,+Sean.+500+Days:+The+War+in+Eastern+Europe,+1944-1945&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9qbO1BIzOL&amp;sig=DY6T0ZHHm3E4wLtqY2R8EEiQydw&amp;hl=da&amp;ei=67gsS9eiOIjj-Qa1jLGEBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=500 Days: The War in Eastern Europe, 1944–1945 |publisher=Dorrance Publishing Co |location=Pittsburgh |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4349-6159-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet forces launched six major offensives against the German and Latvian forces entrenched in the Courland Pocket between 15 October 1944, and 4 April 1945.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The German two-phase withdrawals during the execution of the second stage of the Soviet [[Baltic Offensive]] (14 September – 24 November 1944), subsequent to the pocket being formed in the Baltic Offensive's first stage, the [[Memel Offensive Operation]].

From 27 October to 25 November – Soviets launched an offensive trying to break through the front toward [[Skrunda]] and [[Saldus]] including, at one point initiating a simultaneous attack by 52 divisions.&lt;ref name="LE"/&gt; Soviets also attacked southeast of Liepāja in an attempt to capture that port. 80 divisions assaulted the Germans from 1 to 15 November in a front 12&amp;nbsp;km wide.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} The Soviet breakthrough stalled after roughly 4 kilometers.&lt;ref name="historia.lv"&gt;[http://www.historia.lv/publikacijas/gramat/mangulis/09.nod.htm Mangulis, V.

The 3rd phase of the fighting (also known as "the other Christmas Battle") started on 21 December with a Soviet attack on Germans near Saldus. The Soviet [[2nd Baltic Front|2nd Baltic]] (northern sector) and [[1st Baltic Front|1st Baltic]] Fronts (southern sector) commenced a blockade, precipitating the German defence of the Courland perimeter during Soviet attempts to reduce it. In this battle, serving with the 2nd Baltic Front's [[22nd Army (Soviet Union)|22nd Army]], the [[Latvian Riflemen Soviet Divisions|Latvian 130th Rifle Corps]] faced their opposites in the [[19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian)|Latvian 19th SS Division]]. The battle ended on 31 December and the front was stabilized.

On 15 January 1945, Army Group North was renamed [[Army Group Courland]] under Colonel-General [[Lothar Rendulic]]. In the middle of January [[Heinz Guderian]] got Hitler’s permission to withdraw 7 divisions from Courland, however, Hitler refused to consider a total withdrawal.&lt;ref name="historia.lv"/&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2013}} The [[4th Panzer Division]], [[31st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|31st]], [[32nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|32nd]], [[93rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|93rd Infantry Divisions]], [[11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland|11th SS Division Nordland]] and the remnants of the battered [[227th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|227th]], [[218th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|218th]] and [[389th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|389th]] Infantry Divisions and [[15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Latvian)|15th Latvian SS-Division]] were evacuated over the sea. On 23 January Soviets launched an offensive trying to break through the front toward Liepāja and Saldus. They managed to take the bridgeheads on [[Bārta]] and Vārtāja rivers but were once again driven off by the Germans.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The fifth battle started on 12 February with a Soviet attack against the Germans towards {{Interlanguage link multi|Džūkste|lv}}. Other attacks took place south of Liepāja where the Soviets massed 21 divisions, and south of Tukums where 11 divisions tried to break through the German front and take the town. On 16 February the Soviets started an offensive against the 19th Division.

===Surrender===
On 8 May, Germany's [[Head of State]] and President [[Karl Dönitz]] ordered Colonel-General [[Carl Hilpert]] – the Army Group's last commander – to surrender. Hilpert, his personal staff, and staffs of three Armies surrendered to Marshal [[Leonid Govorov]], the commander of the Leningrad Front. At this time, the group still consisted of the remnants of 27 divisions and one brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Kozlov |editor-first=M.

On 8 May, General Otto Friedrich Rauser succeeded in obtaining better surrender terms from the Soviet command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thorwald |first=Jürgen |editor-last=Wieck |editor-first=Fred |title=Flight in the Winter: Russia Conquers, January to May 1945 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York |year=1951 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 May, the Soviet commission in Peilei started to interrogate the captive staff of Army Group Courland, and general collection of prisoners began.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

By 12 May, approximately 135,000 German troops surrendered in the Courland Pocket. On 23 May, the Soviet collection of the German troops in the Courland Pocket was completed. A total of about 180,000 German troops were taken into captivity from the Baltic area. The bulk of the prisoners of war were initially held at the [[Valdai Hills]] camps.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==Historiography==
===Soviet and Russian accounts===
The First Courland Battle was intended to destroy German forces. After that failure, official accounts ignore Courland, stating only that the Soviet goal was to prevent the Germans from escaping.&lt;ref name=Grier&gt;{{cite book |first=Howard D. |last=Grier |title=Hitler, Dönitz, and the Baltic Sea: The Third Reich's Last Hope, 1944–1945 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-59-114-345-1 |pages=81–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this account, the Soviet actions in Courland were defensive [[Blockade|blocking]] operations. Hostilities consisted of containing German breakout attempts, and the Red Army made no concerted effort to capture the Courland Pocket,{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} which was of little strategic importance after the isolation of [[Army Group North]], whereas the main offensive effort was required for the [[Vistula-Oder Offensive|Vistula-Oder]] and [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin Offensive]]s. Soviet forces suffered correspondingly low casualties. The modern research of [[Grigoriy Krivosheev]] indicates a total of 160,948 Soviet casualties between 16 February and 8 May 1945": 30,501 "irrecoverable" and 130,447 "medical" losses.&lt;ref name=krivosheev2001&gt;{{cite book |title=Россия и СССР в войнах XX века: Потери вооруженных сил.

According to the Russian historian [[Aleksei Isaev (historian)|Aleksei Isaev]], Courland was a peripheral front for both the Soviets and Germans. The Soviet goal was to prevent the German troops there from being transported by sea to reinforce the defense of Berlin. Soviet operations intended to further isolate and also destroy the enemy, but the strength of the attacking troops was too low to make any significant progress in the difficult terrain. However, the Soviet commanders worked competently and as a result the casualties were low.&lt;ref name=isayev&gt;{{cite interview |last=Isayev |first=Aleksey |interviewer=Dmitriy Zakharov |title=Unknown Winter of 1945 |url=http://echo.msk.ru/programs/victory/644363-echo |language=Russian |work=Price of Victory |publisher=[[Echo of Moscow]] |location=Moscow |date=28 December 2009 |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western sources===
Stalin had initially been intent on destroying the German forces in Courland, reporting in September 1944 that he was "mopping up" in the Baltics, and in November, that the Germans were "now being hammered to a finish."&lt;ref name=Grier /&gt; As late as March 1945, Stalin was still making guarantees that German forces in Courland would soon be defeated.&lt;ref name=Grier /&gt; This victory was necessary, in Stalin's eyes, to re-establish Soviet control over its 1941 frontiers following the annexation of the Baltic states.&lt;ref name=Buttar&gt;{{cite book |first=Prit |last=Buttar |title=Battleground Prussia: The Assault on Germany's Eastern Front 1944–45 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=Oxford |year=2012 |isbn=978-1849081900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets launched six offensives to defeat the German [[Army Group Courland]].&lt;ref name="LE"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grier/&gt; Throughout the campaign against the Courland pocket, Soviet forces did not advance more than 25 miles anywhere along the front, ending no more than a few kilometers forward of their original positions after seven months of conflict.&lt;ref name=Grier /&gt; The Soviet operations were hampered by the difficult terrain and bad weather.&lt;ref name=Grier /&gt;

The German army group reported inflicting heavy losses on the Soviets.&lt;ref name=Grier/&gt;&lt;ref name=WGNW&gt;{{cite book |first1=Steven D. |last1=Mercatante |first2=Robert M. |last2=Citino | authorlink = Robert M.

The withdrawal of Soviet units starting from December 1944, indicates that the Soviet command did not consider Courland to be as important as other sectors of the Eastern Front. Destroying the German forces there was not worth the effort and the goal was now to keep them from breaking out. The next three offensives were most likely intended to prevent the evacuation of German troops by sea.&lt;ref name=Grier /&gt; By the start of April 1945, the Soviets viewed the German forces in Courland as not much more than self-supporting prisoners.&lt;ref name=Grier /&gt;

==Aftermath==
