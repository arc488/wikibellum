The '''Battle of Thermopylae''', on 24–25 April 1941, was part of the [[Battle of Greece|German invasion of Greece]] during [[World War II]].

==Background==
Following the retreat of Allied forces from the mountain passes at [[Mount Olympus, Greece|Olympus]] and [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] forces began to set up defensive positions at the coastal pass at [[Thermopylae]], famous for the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] in 480 BC. The New Zealand Army's [[2nd Division (New Zealand)|2nd Infantry Division]] under Lieutenant-General [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|Bernard Freyberg]] was given the task of defending the pass, while elements of the Australian [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Infantry Division]], under Major General [[Iven Giffard Mackay|Iven Mackay]], defended the village of [[Brallos]].

In the New Zealand sector, the [[5th Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|5th Brigade]] was deployed along the coastal road, the foothills south of [[Lamia (city)|Lamia]], and the [[Spercheios River]], with the [[4th Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|4th Brigade]] was on the right flank, where it had established coast-watching patrols. The [[6th Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|6th Brigade]] was in reserve. The Australian force defending Brallos was comprised predominantly of two battalions from the [[19th Brigade (Australia)|19th Brigade]], under Brigadier [[George Alan Vasey|George Vasey]]: the [[2/4th Australian Infantry Battalion|2/4th]] and [[2/8th Australian Infantry Battalion|2/8th]] battalions. On 19 April they were augmented by the [[2/1st Australian Infantry Battalion|2/1st]] and [[2/5th Australian Infantry Battalion|2/5th]] battalions (from the 16th and 17th Brigades respectively), which were also put under Vasey's command. Later that day and during the early hours of 20 April, the [[2/11th Australian Infantry Battalion|2/11th Battalion]], the third battalion comprising the 19th Brigade, also arrived at Brallos.

Freyberg and Mackay had been informing their subordinates that there would be no more withdrawals, but both were unaware of higher level discussions on the evacuation. After the battle, Mackay was quoted as saying: "I thought that we'd hang on for about a fortnight and be beaten by weight of numbers."&lt;ref name="awm"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1070245--1-.pdf|title=Greece, Crete and Syria|last=Long|first=Gavin|publisher=Australian War Memorial|year=1953|series=Australia in the War of 1939–1945. Series 1&amp;nbsp;– Army|volume=Volume 2|location=Canberra|pages=95–130|oclc=3134080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 23 April, [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps#World War II|ANZAC Corps]] was ordered to retreat.  It was decided that Thermopylae and Brallos would nevertheless be held by a rearguard comprising two brigades. The New Zealand 6th Brigade, under Brigadier [[Harold Barrowclough]] and the Australian 19th Brigade were to hold the passes as long as possible, allowing the other units to withdraw. Vasey said: "Here we bloody well are and here we bloody well stay."&lt;ref name="awm"/&gt; This was interpreted by Vasey's [[brigade major]], A.&amp;nbsp;T.&amp;nbsp;J. "Ding" Bell, as meaning that the brigade would "hold its present defensive positions come what may",&lt;ref name="awm"/&gt; until the withdrawal had been completed.

==Action==
A German [[Kampfgruppe|battlegroup]] based on the [[6th Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|6th Mountain Division]], under ''Generalmajor'' [[Ferdinand Schörner]], attacked at 1130 hours on 24 April, meeting fierce resistance. Another battlegroup, drawn from the [[5th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|5th Panzer Division]] also attacked.

The Australians and New Zealanders held out for an entire day, destroyed 15 German tanks and inflicted considerable casualties. With the delaying action accomplished, the rearguard retreated towards another defensive position at [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Germans would continue their march down the country, eventually [[Axis occupation of Greece|occupying the country]].

The absence of the [[Greek Army]], from a battle at a site as significant to the national psyche as Thermopylae, was controversial within Greece, as General [[Georgios Tsolakoglou]] had already capitulated. After the war, [[Aris Velouchiotis]] – a veteran of the 1941 campaign and leader of the [[Greek People's Liberation Army]] – argued that this fact was an eternal "shame" for the Greek regime that didn't take part in the battle.
