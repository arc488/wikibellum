The '''First Battle of Kiev''' was the German name for the operation that resulted in a very large [[encirclement]] of [[Red Army|Soviet troops]] in the vicinity of [[Kiev]] during World War II. This encirclement is considered the largest encirclement in the history of warfare (by number of troops). The operation ran from 7 August to 26 September 1941 as part of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the [[Axis powers|Axis]] invasion of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Read|2005|p=731}} In [[Military history of the Soviet Union|Soviet military history]], it is referred to as the '''Kiev Strategic Defensive Operation''', with the somewhat different dates of 7 July – 26 September 1941.{{sfn|Krivosheev|1997|p=114}}

Much of the [[Southwestern Front (Soviet Union)|Southwestern Front]] of the [[Red Army]] ([[Mikhail Kirponos]]) was encircled but small groups of Red Army troops managed to escape the [[Pocket (military)|pocket]], days after the German panzers met east of the city, including the headquarters of Marshal [[Semyon Budyonny]], Marshal [[Semyon Timoshenko]] and [[Political commissar|Commissar]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Kirponos was trapped behind German lines and was killed while trying to break out.

The battle was an unprecedented defeat for the Red Army, exceeding even the [[Battle of Białystok–Minsk]] of June–July 1941. The encirclement trapped 452,700 soldiers, 2,642 guns and mortars and 64 tanks, of which scarcely 15,000 had escaped from the encirclement by 2 October. The Southwestern Front suffered 700,544 casualties, including 616,304 killed, captured or missing during the battle. The [[5th Army (Soviet Union)|5th]], [[37th Army (Soviet Union)|37th]], [[26th Army (Soviet Union)|26th]], [[21st Army (Soviet Union)|21st]] and the [[38th Army (Soviet Union)|38th]] armies, consisting of 43 divisions, were almost annihilated and the [[40th Army (Soviet Union)|40th Army]] suffered many losses. Like the Western Front before it, the Southwestern Front had to be recreated almost from scratch.

==Prelude==
After the rapid progress of [[Army Group Centre]] through the central sector of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]], a huge [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] developed around its junction with [[Army Group South]] by late July 1941. On 7–8 July 1941 the German forces managed to break through the fortified [[Stalin Line]] in the southeast portion of [[Zhytomyr Oblast]], which ran along the 1939 Soviet border.&lt;ref name=eohou&gt;Koval, M. ''[http://resource.history.org.ua/cgi-bin/eiu/history.exe?Z21ID=&amp;I21DBN=EIU&amp;P21DBN=EIU&amp;S21STN=1&amp;S21REF=10&amp;S21FMT=eiu_all&amp;C21COM=S&amp;S21CNR=20&amp;S21P01=0&amp;S21P02=0&amp;S21P03=TRN=&amp;S21COLORTERMS=0&amp;S21STR=Kyivska_oboronna_operaciya The 1941 Kiev Defense Operation (КИЇВСЬКА ОБОРОННА ОПЕРАЦІЯ 1941)]''. Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine&lt;/ref&gt; By 11 July 1941 the Axis ground forces reached the Dnieper tributary [[Irpin River]] ({{convert|15-20|km|miles|abbr=on}} to the west from Kiev).&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; The initial attempt to enter the city right away was thwarted by troops of the Kiev ukrep-raion (KUR, Kiev fortified district) and counter offensive of 5th and 6th armies.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; Following that the advance on Kiev was halted and main effort shifted towards the Korosten ukrep-raion where was concentrated the Soviet 5th Army.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; At the same time the [[1st Panzer Army]] was forced to transition to defense due to a counteroffensive of the Soviet 26th Army.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; A substantial Soviet force, nearly the entire [[Southwestern Front (Soviet Union)|Southwestern Front]], positioned in and around [[Kiev]] was located in the salient.{{sfn|Glantz|2011|pp=54–55}}{{sfn|Clark|1965|p=130}} By the end of July the Soviet front lost some of its units due to the critical situation of the [[Southern Front (Soviet Union)|Southern Front]] (6th and 12th armies) caused by the German 17th army.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt;

While lacking mobility and armor due to high losses in tanks at the [[Battle of Uman]]{{sfn|Clark|1965|p=130}} on 3 August 1941,&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; they nonetheless posed a significant threat to the German advance and were the largest single concentration of Soviet troops on the Eastern Front at that time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Both Soviet 6th and 12th armies were encircled at [[Uman]] where some 102,000 Red Army soldiers and officers were taken prisoners.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt;

On 30 July 1941, the German forces resumed their advance onto Kiev with the German 6th army attacking positions between the Soviet 26th army and the Kiev ukrep-raion troops.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; On 7 August 1941 it was halted again by the Soviet 5th, 37th, 26th and supported by the Pinsk Naval Flotilla.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; With the help of the local population around the city of Kiev along the {{convert|45|km|miles|abbr=on}} frontline segment were dug anti-tanks ditches and installed other obstacles, established 750 pillboxes, planted 100,000 of mines.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; Some 35,000 soldiers were mobilized from local population along with some partisan detachments and couple of [[armored train]]s.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt;

On 19 July [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] issued [[List of Adolf Hitler's directives|Directive No. 33]] which would cancel the assault on Moscow in favor of driving south to complete the encirclement of Soviet forces surrounded in Kiev.{{sfn|Clark|1965|p=101}} However, on 12 August 1941, [[List of Adolf Hitler's directives|Supplement to Directive No. 34]] was issued, and it represented a compromise between Hitler, who was convinced the correct strategy was to clear the salient occupied by Soviet forces on right flank of Army Group Center in the vicinity of Kiev before resuming the drive to Moscow, and [[Franz Halder|Halder]], [[Fedor von Bock|Bock]] and [[Heinz Guderian|Guderian]], who advocated an advance on Moscow as soon as possible. The compromise required [[2nd Panzer Group|2nd]] and [[3rd Panzer Group|3rd]] Panzer Groups of Army Group Centre, which were redeploying in order to aid [[Army Group North]] and [[Army Group South]] respectively, be returned to Army Group Centre, together with the [[4th Panzer Group]] of Army Group North, once their objectives were achieved. Then the three Panzer Groups, under the control of Army Group Center, would lead the advance on Moscow.{{sfn|Glantz|2011|p=55}} Initially, Halder, chief of staff of the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|OKH]], and Bock, commander of Army Group Center, were satisfied by the compromise, but soon their optimism faded as the operational realities of the plan proved too challenging.{{sfn|Glantz|2011|p=56}}

On 18 August, [[Oberkommando des Heeres|OKH]] submitted a strategic survey (''Denkschrift'') to Hitler regarding the continuation of operations in the East. The paper made the case for the drive to Moscow, arguing once again that Army Groups North and South were strong enough to accomplish their objectives without any assistance from Army Group Center. It pointed out that there was enough time left before winter to conduct only a single decisive operation against Moscow.{{sfn|Glantz|2011|p=56}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L20392, Kiew, Pioniere errichten Pontonbrücke.jpg|thumb|left|German pontoon bridge over the Dnieper near Kiev in September 1941, set up in less than 24 hours]]
On 20 August, Hitler rejected the proposal based on the idea that the most important objective was to deprive the Soviets of their industrial areas. On 21 August [[Alfred Jodl|Jodl]] of [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]] issued a directive, which summarized Hitler's instructions, to [[Walther von Brauchitsch|Brauchitsch]] commander of the Army. The paper reiterated that the capture of Moscow before the onset of winter was not a primary objective. Rather, that the most important missions before the onset of winter were to seize the [[Crimea]], and the industrial and coal region of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]]; isolate the oil-producing regions of the [[Caucasus]] from the rest of the Soviet Union and in the north, to encircle [[Leningrad]] and link up with the Finns. Among other instructions, it also instructed that Army Group Center is to allocate sufficient forces to ensure the destruction of the "Russian 5th Army" and, at the same time, to prepare to repel enemy counterattacks in the central sector of its front.{{sfn|Glantz|2011|p=57}} Hitler referred to the Soviet forces in the salient collectively as the "Russian 5th Army".{{sfn|Glantz|2011|p=60}} [[Franz Halder|Halder]] was dismayed, and later described Hitler's plan as "utopian and unacceptable", concluding that the orders were contradictory and Hitler alone must bear the responsibility for inconsistency of his orders and that the OKH can no longer assume responsibility for what was occurring; however, Hitler's instructions still accurately reflected the original intent of the Barbarossa directive of which the OKH was aware all along.{{sfn|Glantz|2011|p=58}} [[Gerhard Engel|Engel]] in his diary for 21 August 1941, simply summarized it as, "it was a black day for the Army".{{sfn|Glantz|2011|p=59}} Halder offered his own resignation and advised Brauchitsch to do the same. However, Brauchitsch declined, stating Hitler would not accept the gesture, and nothing would change anyhow.{{sfn|Glantz|2011|p=58}} [[Franz Halder|Halder]] withdrew his offer of resignation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

On 23 August, [[Franz Halder]] convened with Bock and Guderian in [[Barysaw|Borisov]] (in [[Belorussia]]), and afterwards flew with Guderian to Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia. During a meeting between Guderian and Hitler, with neither Halder nor Brauchitsch present, Hitler allowed Guderian to make the case for driving on to Moscow, and then rejected his argument. Hitler claimed his decision to secure the northern and southern sectors of western Soviet Union were "tasks which stripped the Moscow problem of much of its significance" and was "not a new proposition, but a fact I have clearly and unequivocally stated since the beginning of the operation." Hitler also argued that the situation was even more critical because the opportunity to encircle the Soviet forces in the salient was "an unexpected opportunity, and a reprieve from past failures to trap the Soviet armies in the south."{{sfn|Glantz|2011|p=58}} Hitler also declared, "the objections that time will be lost and the offensive on Moscow might be undertaken too late, or that the armoured units might no longer be technically able to fulfil their mission, are not valid." Hitler reiterated that once the flanks of Army Group Center were cleared, especially the salient in the south, then he would allow the army to resume its drive on Moscow; an offensive, he concluded, which "must not fail".{{sfn|Glantz|2011|p=59}} In point of fact, Hitler had already issued the orders for the shift of Guderian's panzer group to the south.{{sfn|Guderian|1952|p=202}}  Guderian returned to his [[2nd Panzer Group|panzer group]] and began the southern thrust in an effort to encircle the Soviet forces in the salient.{{sfn|Glantz|2011|p=58}}

The bulk of [[2nd Panzer Group]] and the [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|2nd Army]] were detached from Army Group Centre and sent south.{{sfn|Clark|1965|pp=111, 139}} Its mission was to encircle the [[Southwestern Front (Soviet Union)|Southwestern Front]], commanded by [[Semyon Budyonny|Budyonny]], in conjunction with [[1st Panzer Group]] of [[Army Group South]] under [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Kleist]], which was driving up from a southeasterly direction.{{sfn|Clark|1965|p=133}}

Following the crossing of [[Dnieper]] by German forces on 22 August 1941, the city of Kiev came under threat of complete encirclement and the command of the Southwestern Front appealed to the [[Stavka]] to allow withdrawal of forces from Kiev.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; However the permission to do so was not received until 17 September 1941 when the encirclement was completed at [[Lokhvytsia]] in Poltava region.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt;

==Battle==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
[[File: Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L19885, Russland, Heinz Guderian vor Gefechtsstand.jpg|thumb|right|Guderian at a forward command post for one of his panzer regiments, 1941]]
The Panzer armies made rapid progress. On 12 September, [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Kleist]]'s [[1st Panzer Group]], which had by now turned north and crossed the [[Dnieper]] river, emerged from its bridgeheads at Cherkassy and Kremenchuk. Continuing north, it cut across the rear of [[Semyon Budyonny|Budyonny]]'s [[Southwestern Front (Soviet Union)|Southwestern Front]]. On 16 September, it made contact with [[Heinz Guderian|Guderian]]'s [[2nd Panzer Group]] advancing south, at the town of [[Lokhvytsia|Lokhvitsa]], 120 miles east of Kiev.{{sfn|Clark|1965|pp=135, 141}} [[Semyon Budyonny|Budyonny]] was now trapped and soon relieved by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s order of 13 September.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

After that, the fate of the encircled Soviet armies was sealed. With no mobile forces or supreme commander left, there was no possibility to effect a breakout. The infantry of the German [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th Army]] and [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]] of Army Group South soon arrived, along with 2nd Army (also on loan from Army Group Center and marching behind Guderian's tanks).  They systematically began to reduce the [[Pocket (military)|pocket]] assisted by the two Panzer armies. The encircled Soviet armies at Kiev did not give up easily. A savage battle in which the Soviets were bombarded by artillery, tanks and aircraft had to be fought before the pocket had finally fallen, the city was decimated, with most of its buildings reduced to rubble
{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

By 19 September, Kiev had fallen, but the encirclement battle continued. After 10 days of heavy fighting, the last remnants of troops east of Kiev surrendered on 26 September. Encircled became several Soviet armies, 5th, 37th, 26th, and separate detachments of 38th and 21st armies.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; The Germans claimed 600,000 Red Army soldiers (up to 665,000)&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; captured, although these claims have included a large number of civilians suspected of evading capture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

During withdrawal from Kiev, on 20–22 September 1941 at Shumeikove Hai near Dryukivshchyna (today in [[Lokhvytsia Raion]]) perished several members of headquarter staff [[Mikhail Kirponos]] (commander), [[Mykhailo Burmystenko|Mikhail Burmistenko]] (a member of military council), and Vasiliy Tupikov (chief of staff).&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt; Some 15,000 Soviet troops managed to break through the encirclement.&lt;ref name=eohou/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L20208, Ukraine, Kiew, deutscher Wachposten auf der Zitadelle.jpg|left|thumb|German sentinel in the citadel of Kiev on 19 September.]]

By virtue of Guderian's southward turn, the Wehrmacht destroyed the entire Southwestern Front east of Kiev during September, inflicting 600,000 losses on the Red Army, while Soviet forces west of Moscow conducted a futile and costly offensive against German Army Group Center near Smolensk. These operations, such as the [[Yelnya Offensive]], were conducted over very bad terrain against defenders in fortified strong points, and nearly all of these counter-offensives ended in disaster for the [[Red Army]].  As a result of these failed offensives, Red Army formations defending Moscow were seriously weakened.  With its southern flank secured, Army Group Center launched [[Operation Typhoon]] in the direction of Vyazma in October.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Over the objections of [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], Army Group South was ordered to resume the offensive and overran nearly all of the Crimea and [[Left-bank Ukraine]] before reaching the edges of the Donbas industrial region.  However, after four months of continuous operations his forces were at the brink of exhaustion, and suffered a major defeat in the [[Battle of Rostov (1941)]].  Army Group South's infantry fared little better and [[First Battle of Kharkov|failed to capture]] the vital city of [[Kharkov]] before nearly all of its factories, skilled laborers and equipment were evacuated east of the [[Ural Mountains]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Assessment==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L29208, Ukraine, Kiew, deutsche Pak auf der Zitadelle.jpg|thumb|German artillery overlooking the Dnieper river after the fall of Kiev]]
[[File:Defense of Kiev OBVERSE.jpg|110px|right|thumb|107,540 Soviet personnel were awarded the [[Medal "For the Defence of Kiev"]] from 21 June 1961.]]

Immediately after World War II ended, prominent German commanders argued that had operations at Kiev been delayed and had Operation Typhoon been launched in September rather than October, the ''Wehrmacht'' would have reached and captured Moscow before the onset of winter.{{sfn|Glantz|2001|p=23}} [[Heinz Guderian]] and [[Fedor von Bock]] in particular fiercely argued that the "diversion" to Kiev would have dire consequences if the operation dragged on for too long. Winter was coming in a few weeks, and if Moscow was not taken before the first snow, the entire operation would [[Rasputitsa#World War II|bog down in the mud]]. Indeed, this is what happened.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

[[David Glantz]] argued, however, that had Operation Typhoon been launched in September, it would have met greater resistance due to Soviet forces not having been weakened by their offensives east of Smolensk. The offensive would have also been launched with an extended right flank.{{sfn|Glantz|2001|p=23}} Glantz also claims that regardless of the final position of German troops when winter came, they would have still faced a counteroffensive by the 10 reserve armies raised by the Soviets toward the end of the year, who would also be better equipped by the vast industrial resources in the area of Kiev. Glantz asserts that had Kiev not been taken before the [[Battle of Moscow]], the entire operation would have ended in a disaster for the Germans.{{sfn|Glantz|2001|p=23}}
