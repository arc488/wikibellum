The '''Battle of Cape St. George''' was a [[naval battle]] of the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]] of [[World War II]] fought on 25 November 1943, between [[Cape St. George]], [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], and [[Buka Island]] (now part of the [[North Solomons Province]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]). It was the last engagement of surface ships in the [[Solomon Islands campaign]]. During the engagement, a force of five US Navy destroyers led by [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Arleigh Burke]] intercepted a similar sized Japanese force that was withdrawing from Buka towards Rabaul, having landed reinforcements on the island. In the ensuing fight, three Japanese destroyers were sunk and one was damaged, with no losses amongst the US forces.

==Background==
The Americans had landed troops from the 3rd Marine Division around [[Landings at Cape Torokina|Torokina]] on [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] on 1 November 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; Judging the landings a ruse, and that the real Allied objective were the airfields around Buka to the north of Bougainville, the Japanese delayed launching a concerted counterattack on Cape Torokina, and instead determined to reinforce Buka.&lt;ref&gt;Costello, ''The Pacific War 1941–1945'', p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, 920 [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] troops were embarked on the destroyers {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Amagiri|1930|2}}, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Yūgiri|1930|2}} and {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Uzuki|1925|2}} under the command of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Katsumori Yamashiro and were sent to reinforce the garrison, escorted by the destroyers {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Ōnami|1942|2}} and {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Makinami|1941|2}} under the command of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Kiyoto Kagawa]]. The convoy was spotted by reconnaissance aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;Costello, ''The Pacific War 1941–1945'', p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="o'hara"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microworks.net/pacific/battles/cape_stgeorge.htm |author=O'Hara, Vincent |title=Battle of Cape St. George: November 25, 1943 |accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Navy]] sent [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Arleigh Burke]]'s [[Destroyer Squadron 23]], composed of Destroyer Division 45 ({{USS|Charles Ausburne|DD-570|2}}, {{USS|Claxton|DD-571|2}}, and {{USS|Dyson|DD-572|2}}), under Burke's direct command, and Destroyer Division 46 ({{USS|Converse|DD-509|2}} and {{USS|Spence|DD-512|2}}), under [[Commander (naval)|Commander]] [[Bernard L. Austin|Bernard Austin]] to intercept it. Meanwhile, nine [[PT boat]]s under Commander Henry Farrow moved into the Buka Passage to engage the Japanese if Burke's force was unable to make contact.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 353–354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
The Japanese battle plan divided their force into two columns,&lt;ref name=Tuohy239&gt;Tuohy, ''America's Fighting Admirals'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; with the three transport destroyers trailing the two escort destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Destroyer Squadron 23: Combat Exploits of Arleigh Burke's Gallant Force'', pp. 248–249.&lt;/ref&gt; The American battle plan also divided their force into two columns using tactics devised by Burke and first employed successfully by Commander [[Frederick Moosbrugger]] at the [[Battle of Vella Gulf]] the previous August.  One column would make a torpedo attack while the other took up a supporting position ready to open gunfire as soon as the first column's torpedo attack struck home.&lt;ref name="Morison, p. 355"&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese destroyers landed the 920&amp;nbsp; troops and supplies and embarked 700 [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] aviation personnel being withdrawn as Allied bombing had rendered the airfield at Buka non-operational.&lt;ref name="o'hara"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese force was returning to [[Rabaul]] when Farrow's PT boats spotted four of the Japanese ships on their radar just after midnight; however, the PT boats mistook the Japanese vessels for friendly forces and hove to further ashore. Two of the Japanese ships subsequently attacked the PT boats, firing on them and attempting to ram ''PT-318''. They failed to score any hits, though, while one of the PT boats, ''PT-64'', fired a torpedo which missed its target.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the Japanese destroyers steamed west towards Cape St. George.&lt;ref name=rickard/&gt;

Around 01:41, Kagawa's two screening destroyers were picked up by radar by Burke's destroyers, which had moved into position between Cape St. George and Buka,&lt;ref name=rickard/&gt; with ''Dyson'' making contact first.&lt;ref name="o'hara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morison, p. 355"/&gt;  Poor visibility prevented the Japanese from spotting the American ships in turn.  Burke elected to use his own division for the torpedo attack. Superior radar allowed the American ships to approach within {{convert|5500|yd|m}} and launch their torpedoes at about 01:55 before the Japanese sighted them. ''Onami'' was hit by several torpedoes and sank immediately with all hands, including Kagawa. ''Makinami'' was hit by one torpedo and disabled.&lt;ref name=Morison356&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

Burke's force established radar contact with the rest of the Japanese force at {{convert|13000|yd|m}} soon after launching their torpedoes and turned to pursue; Yamashiro's three transport destroyers fled north, pursued by Burke's division, while ''Converse'' and ''Spence'' from Austin's division finished off the disabled ''Makinami'' with torpedoes and gunfire. Burke's three destroyers steadily gained on the three heavily laden Japanese destroyers, opening fire around 02:22, scoring several hits. ''Uzuki'' was hit by one dud shell and escaped without significant damage. ''Amagiri'' escaped untouched. Around 02:25, the Japanese ships split up and fled in different directions. Burke chose to pursue ''Yugiri'' with his entire force and sank her at about 03:28 after a fierce engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', pp. 356–357.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
By 03:45, Burke’s and Austin's divisions had linked up, continuing to push north to pursue the withdrawing Japanese ships.&lt;ref name="o'hara"/&gt; Burke subsequently called off the attempt at 04:04, low on fuel and ammunition, and needing to withdraw before daylight, when Japanese aircraft would likely begin operations to search for them. In the event, the only aircraft the US ships spotted once daylight came were friendly [[AirSols]] [[P-38 Lightning]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, ''Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier'', p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle represented a significant victory for the Americans and was later described as an "almost perfect action" and Burke was awarded a [[Navy Cross]].&lt;ref name=Tuohy239/&gt; It was the final surface engagement of the Solomon Islands campaign,&lt;ref name="o'hara"/&gt; and the last such action in the wider Pacific for nine months.&lt;ref&gt;Costello, ''The Pacific War 1941–1945'', p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Japanese were able to land their troops and withdraw their supporting personnel, they lost three destroyers sunk and one damaged, without inflicting any losses on the American force.&lt;ref name=rickard&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_cape_saint_george.html |title=Battle of Cape Saint George, 25 November 1943 |author=Rickard, J. |work=History of War |accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the Japanese crews, a total of 647 were killed.&lt;ref name=makina/&gt;&lt;ref name=onami/&gt; A total of 278 survivors were rescued from ''Yugiri'' by the [[Japanese submarine I-177|submarine ''I-177'']].&lt;ref name=Morison353/&gt;
