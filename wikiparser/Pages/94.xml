The '''Battle of Athens''' (also known as the '''Battle of Piraeus Harbour''') on 20 April 1941 is the name given by author [[Roald Dahl]] to a [[Dogfight|dog-fighting]] air battle over [[Athens]] fought for half an hour between the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[Luftwaffe]] towards the end of the [[Battle of Greece]].

[[Roald Dahl]] flew a [[Hawker Hurricane]] in the battle, which he describes in his second autobiography ''[[Going Solo]]'' and in the short story 'Katina'.

According to Dahl, the battle began when the twelve remaining Hurricanes of the Royal Air Force ([[RAF]])'s [[No. 80 Squadron RAF|80 Squadron]], flying in formation over [[Athens]], were attacked by a large group of German [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft, mostly [[Messerschmitt]] [[Bf 109]]s and [[Bf 110]]s along with some [[Junkers Ju 87]]s and [[Junkers Ju 88]]s. According to the citizens of Athens the Germans had 200 planes; according to Dahl, they had 152 bombers and fighters.

In the resulting battle four RAF pilots were shot down and killed, including the famous [[Marmaduke Pattle|Marmaduke "Pat" Pattle]] and the Irish RAF pilot William "Timber" Woods, and one pilot lost his [[Hawker Hurricane]]. Dahl states that Greek observers counted 22 German aircraft shot down, although another source states that the Germans lost eight aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=
