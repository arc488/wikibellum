The '''Battle of Hel''' ({{lang-pl|Obrona Helu}}, literally "the Defense of Hel") was a [[World War II]] engagement fought from 1 September to 2 October 1939 on the [[Hel Peninsula]], of the [[Baltic Sea]] coast, between invading German forces and defending Polish units during the German [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] (also known in Polish historiography as the September Campaign). The defense of the [[Hel Peninsula]] took place around the [[Hel Fortified Area]], a system of [[Second Polish Republic|Polish]] [[fortification]]s that had been constructed in the 1930s near the [[interwar]] border with the German [[Third Reich]].

Beginning on 20 September 1939, after the Polish [[Armia Pomorze|Army Pomorze]] had been defeated in the [[Battle of Tuchola Forest]] and after other Polish coastal strongholds had [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulated]] in the [[Battle of Westerplatte]], [[Battle of Gdynia]] and the [[Battle of Kępa Oksywska]], Hel was the only substantial pocket of Polish military resistance left in northern Poland. It was also the site of the invasion's only naval surface engagement.

The Germans blockaded the defenders of the Hel Peninsula and did not launch major land operations until the end of September 1939. Some 2,800 Polish soldiers under [[Counter Admiral|Rear Admiral]] [[Włodzimierz Steyer]], part of the [[Land Coastal Defence]] formation, defended the Hel Fortified Area for about 32 days, until they surrendered{{Ref|date|b}} due to low supplies and morale.

The Hel Fortified Area had coastal (anti-ship) and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft artillery batteries]]. The {{ill|Coastal Artillery Division|pl|Dywizjon Artylerii Nadbrzeżnej}}'s [[coastal battery|coastal batteries]] comprised one battery of four 152 mm (6-inch) guns, two older batteries of two 105 mm (4.1-inch) guns, and three batteries of eight 75 mm (3-inch) guns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The {{ill|2nd Naval Anti-aircraft Artillery Division|pl|2 Morski Dywizjon Artylerii Przeciwlotniczej}}'s anti-aircraft batteries were equipped with six 75 mm and eight 40 mm (1.6-inch) guns, seventeen machine guns,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and two 120 cm (47-inch) searchlights. Infantry cover for the Hel Fortified Area was provided by a [[Border Defense Corps]] (''KOP'') unit – the {{ill|Hel KOP Battalion|pl|Batalion KOP „Hel"}} under Major {{ill|Jan Wiśniewski|pl|Jan Wiśniewski (major)}} – which had several artillery pieces (four 75 mm, and six 37 mm), sixty-two machine guns, and two large and nine small mortars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Coastal Artillery Division was 162 soldiers strong, the 2nd Naval Anti-aircraft Artillery Division numbered 1,000 personnel, and the KOP battalion, 1,197.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Overall command of the Hel Fortified Area was held by [[Counter Admiral|Rear Admiral]] [[Włodzimierz Steyer]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Hel also became headquarters for the [[Polish Navy]]'s commander, Rear Admiral [[Józef Unrug]], who relocated his command center there on the eve of the invasion, on 31 August 1939, concluding that the Hel Fortified Area was better suited to prolonged defense than the more provisional defenses around his peacetime headquarters in [[Gdynia]]. Unrug also reinforced the Hel garrison with soldiers from his Gdynia garrison.&lt;ref name="Derdej2009-2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Derdej|first=Piotr|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=La5KfmIfGv8C&amp;pg=PA112|title=Westerplatte, Oksywie, Hel 1939|publisher=Bellona|year=2009|isbn=9788311115859|location=Warsaw|page=112|pages=|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1939, some 2,800 soldiers were stationed in the Hel Fortified Area.&lt;ref name="DGW"&gt;{{cite book|author=Williamson|first=David G.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtg8a-0ggkEC&amp;pg=PA68|title=Poland Betrayed: The Nazi-Soviet Invasions of 1939|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=2011|isbn=9780811708289|location=Mechanicsburg, PA|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Hel coastal batteries were the strongest in Poland, they were inadequate to confront the [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] and posed no great threat to any of the German capital ships. Likewise, the Polish air-defense batteries in the region were too few and too light to deter enemy aircraft, and the [[Naval Air Squadron (Poland)|Naval Air Squadron]]'s planes tasked with defending the area, stationed at the nearby town of [[Puck, Poland|Puck]], were both older than their German counterparts and outnumbered by about ten to one.&lt;ref name="Derdej2009-3"/&gt;

In the first week of September, the [[Wehrmacht]] forced Polish [[Armia Pomorze]] units to retreat from the [[Danzig Corridor]] and, having captured Puck, on 9 September began assaulting the Polish forces on the Hel Peninsula.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The advancing German forces included the 42nd Border Guard Regiment and the 5th Cavalry Regiment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Polish forces started a slow retreat toward the port of Hel on the Peninsula. On 10 September the Germans captured the village of [[Swarzewo]], and on 11 September the town of [[Władysławowo]] near the base of the Peninsula.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Polish defenders fortified the next village, [[Chałupy]], about a fifth of the way up the Peninsula. The Germans, having bottled up the Polish units on the Peninsula, did not launch major land operations until month's end.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the night of 12/13 September 1939, the remaining Polish light minelayers laid a [[minefield]] near Hel. The following day, the Luftwaffe sank the Polish light minelayers ORP ''[[ORP Jaskółka|Jaskółka]]'' and ORP ''[[ORP Czapla|Czapla]]'' at the port of [[Jastarnia]], while the remaining minelayers, ORP ''[[ORP Czajka|Czajka]], [[ORP Rybitwa|Rybitwa]]'', and ORP ''[[ORP Żuraw|Żuraw]]'', were damaged. In view of German superiority on the Baltic Sea, the remaining Polish naval units docked at the Hel port and their crews joined the ground forces.&lt;ref name="Comm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Twardowski2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Twardowski|first=Marek|date=1999|title=Pod trzema banderami: Dzieje trałowców typu Jaskółka|trans-title=Under Three Banners: The Story of Jaskółka-tyle Minesweepers|url=|journal=Morza, Statki I Okręty|language=pl|volume=6|pages=|issn=1426-529X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ships' armaments were stripped and converted into additional land-gun emplacements.&lt;ref name="Comm" /&gt;

[[Henry Steele Commager]] writes that the Germans, after initially being stalled by Polish defenses, brought up land-artillery batteries and an [[armored train]] battery to support their barrage. According to Commager, German forces slowly advanced, still facing substantial resistance and [[counterattack]]s, and on 25 September, after the Germans took the village of [[Chałupy]], Polish military engineers detonated [[torpedo]] warheads at the Peninsula's narrowest part, temporarily transforming the Peninsula's far end into an island.&lt;ref name="Comm" /&gt;

A somewhat different account appears in the Polish-language ''Poland's Battles, 1939–1945: an Encyclopedic Guide'', edited by {{ill|Krzysztof Komorowski|pl|Krzysztof Komorowski (historyk) }}. The chapter on the Battle of Hel states that no substantial land engagements took place until 28 September, when German units slowly advanced toward Chałupy. In this account, the major German push took place on 30 September 1939. The German units assigned to take Hel, the 374th Infantry Regiment and the 207th Light Artillery Regiment, captured Chałupy on 30 September, and shortly afterward the Poles detonated the torpedo warheads – but the resulting damage was "less than expected", though it wrecked the Peninsula's railroad line.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 1 October 1939 the [[Polish Navy]]'s commander, Rear Admiral Józef Unrug, taking into account that the Polish outpost was running out of supplies and that no relief force would be coming, and in view of low troop morale, with two mutiny attempts having been quelled on 29 and 30 September,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; gave orders to [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulate]].&lt;ref name="Fort" /&gt; Some Polish soldiers attempted to flee across the Baltic Sea to [[Sweden]] on the remaining light craft and civilian vessels, but most were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Germans occupied the Hel Peninsula by 2 October.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Derdej2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Derdej|first=Piotr|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=La5KfmIfGv8C&amp;pg=PA186|title=Westerplatte, Oksywie, Hel 1939|publisher=Bellona|year=2009|isbn=9788311115859|location=Warsaw|page=186|pages=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some accounts of the Battle of Hel report the sinking on 1 October of the German minesweeper [[SMS M85|''M85'']] by a mine near the Hel Peninsula, with 24 fatalities. The minefield had been laid by the Polish submarine ORP ''[[ORP Żbik|Żbik]]'' as part of [[Worek Plan|Plan Sack]]. ORP ''Żbik'' and two other submarines, ORP ''[[ORP Sęp (1938)|Sęp]]'' and ORP ''[[ORP Ryś|Ryś]]'' – stationed at Hel – had gone to sea on 1 September.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haarr|first=Geirr H.|title=The Gathering Storm: The Naval War in Northern Europe: September 1939 – April 1940|publisher=Seaforth|year=2013|isbn=9781848321403|location=Barnsley|pp=50, 52, 55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ZalogaMadej1990"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Zaloga|first=Steve |last-author-amp=yes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1EpAQAAMAAJ|title=The Polish Campaign, 1939|author2=Madej|first2=W.

Polish battle casualties were light – some 50 dead and 150 wounded. About 3,600 Polish soldiers and sailors were taken prisoner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; German losses were similar, estimated at a few dozen dead and wounded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Ref|Casualties|d}} Some remaining Polish light vessels, including light minelayers, gunboats, and noncombatant units such as tugboats, which were not sunk by air raids, may (sources vary) have been [[scuttled]] before the capitulation. Either way, most were either captured by the Germans or raised from the shallow waters and pressed into German service in subsequent weeks.&lt;ref name="kanonierki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Twardowski2" /&gt;

After Hel's surrender, the only organized military resistance in Poland was conducted by [[Independent Operational Group Polesie]], which capitulated after the [[Battle of Kock (1939)|Battle of Kock]] on 5 October 1939, marking the end of organized resistance to the German invasion.&lt;ref name="Zaloga2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Zaloga|first=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IXshAQAAIAAJ|title=Poland 1939: The Birth of Blitzkrieg|publisher=Praeger|year=2002|isbn=9780275982782|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=12, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
