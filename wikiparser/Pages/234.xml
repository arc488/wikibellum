During [[World War II]], '''Operation Grenade''' was the crossing of the [[Roer]]  river between [[Roermond]] and [[Düren]] by the [[Ninth United States Army|U.S. Ninth Army]], commanded by [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[William Hood Simpson]], in February 1945, which marked the beginning of the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|Allied invasion of Germany]].

On 9 February, the U.S. Ninth Army—operating under [[Field marshal (United_Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]]'s Anglo-Canadian [[21st Army Group]] since the [[Battle of the Bulge]]—was to cross the Roer and link up with the [[First Canadian Army|Canadian First Army]], under [[Lieutenant-general (Canada)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Harry Crerar]], coming from the [[Nijmegen]] area of the [[Netherlands]] in [[Operation Veritable]], which had started at 05:00 on 8 February. However, once the Canadians had advanced, the Germans opened the sluice gates of upstream dams ([[Rur Dam]] and [[Urft Dam]]). This stopped the Americans from crossing as planned. It had been anticipated that the Germans would try to do this, and that [[General (United_States)|General]] [[Omar Bradley]]′s [[Twelfth United States Army Group|U.S. 12th Army Group]] could capture them in time to stop the flooding.

During the two weeks that the river was flooded, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] would not allow [[Generalfeldmarschall]] [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] to withdraw behind the [[Rhine]], arguing that it would only delay the inevitable fight. He ordered him to fight where his forces stood.

The Ninth Army was finally able to cross the river on 23 February. By then, other Allied forces were also close to the Rhine. German forces west of the Rhine during operations Veritable, [[Operation Blockbuster|Blockbuster]] and Grenade lost 90,000 men, of which more than 50,000 became [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POW). Allied casualties amounted to some 23,000 men.
