The '''Samland Offensive''' was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] offensive on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in the final stages of World War II. It took place in [[Sambia Peninsula|Sambia]] ({{lang-de|Samland}}); ({{lang-ru|земланд|translit=Zemland}}).

The [[East Prussian Offensive]], which commenced on January 13, 1945, had seen the [[Red Army]] clear German forces from much of [[East Prussia]]. The defenders had been driven into a series of [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|pockets]] on the Baltic coast and in the city of [[Königsberg]], in which they were besieged.

Marshal [[Aleksandr Vasilevsky]], who had taken over command of the [[3rd Belorussian Front]] in February, incorporated General [[Hovhannes Bagramyan]]'s [[1st Baltic Front]] into his command from February 22, redesignating it as the Zemland Army Group (or Samland Front).&lt;ref name=duffyp203&gt;Duffy, p.203&lt;/ref&gt; Bagramyan's forces initially laid siege to [[Königsberg]]; the city was eventually [[Battle of Königsberg|stormed]] on April 9. They were then given the task of overcoming the substantial German force still remaining in [[Sambia]].

==German planning==
German defence efforts had largely focused on the port of [[Pillau]] at the tip of the peninsula, which was the main evacuation point for casualties and East Prussian civilians. Throughout the [[Battle of Königsberg]], Sambia had been defended by [[XXVIII Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|Army Detachment Samland]] under the command of General [[Hans Gollnick]], who had tried to maintain a corridor between Königsberg and Pillau.

On April 7, the remnants of [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|Second]] and [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourth]] Armies, which had been destroyed in encirclements at [[East Pomeranian Offensive|Danzig]] and [[Heiligenbeil Pocket|Heiligenbeil]] respectively, were combined as ''[[Armee Ostpreußen]]'' with the task of defending Sambia, the [[Vistula]] delta and the [[Hel Peninsula]]; Gollnick's troops were incorporated in it.

Most of the units of ''Armee Ostpreußen'' were little more than remnants, and the entire formation was very poorly supplied. During the battle for Sambia, its officers were outraged to discover that the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' had maintained large underground depots full of stores and fuel in the woods of the peninsula; the supplies had to be destroyed in the retreat.&lt;ref name=duffyp384&gt;Duffy, p.384&lt;/ref&gt;

==The offensive==
The offensive plan called for the 5th and 39th Armies to break through towards [[Fischhausen]] as the main strike force, with the 11th Guards Army in reserve.&lt;ref name=bagramyanp576&gt;Bagramyan, p.576&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd Guards Army would attack in the north, with the 43rd Army breaking through on the southern flank. There would also be amphibious landings in the south of Sambia. The 3rd Belorussian Front's head of intelligence suggested that they faced up to 100,000 defending troops&lt;ref name=bagramyanp575&gt;Bagramyan, p.575&lt;/ref&gt; but by shortening the frontage of each unit the attackers were able to achieve a superiority of two to one in men and three to one in artillery.&lt;ref name=bagramyanp576&gt;Bagramyan, p.576&lt;/ref&gt; Bagramyan issued a call for the defenders to surrender in exchange for fair treatment and medical assistance for the wounded, but this went unanswered, and the offensive commenced with an artillery barrage and air attacks on April 13.

The initial attack scattered many of the remaining German forces, some falling back towards Pillau. The Soviet [[115th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|115th Rifle Division]] broke through and cleared the 551st Volksgrenadier Division from [[Rauschen]] on the north-western tip of Sambia; the German forces in the north of the peninsula, including the 95th Infantry Division and parts of Heavy Panzer Detachment 502, were driven southwards into [[Palmnicken]] and destroyed.&lt;ref name=schneiderp91&gt;Schneider, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 16, Soviet forces broke through near Fischhausen; parts of XXVI Corps, including the 5th Panzer and 28th Jäger Divisions became cut off on the peninsula at [[Peyse]], and were lost.&lt;ref name=duffyp219&gt;Duffy, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; A defence line, the ''Tenkitten-Riegel'', had been improvised across the narrow strip of land leading to Pillau; to break German resistance, the 11th Guards Army was committed on April 20. Fighting intensified at [[Tenkitten]], where the commander of the [[16th Guards Rifle Corps (Soviet Union)|16th Guards Rifle Corps]], Major-General S S Gur'ev, was killed by a shell fragment on April 22.&lt;ref name=maslovp178&gt;Maslov, p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

The German defensive perimeter was pushed back towards Pillau, which was defended by elements of the 1st, 21st, 58th and other Infantry Divisions; remaining German troops were evacuated to the [[Frische Nehrung]]. Pillau had been heavily fortified, being described by Bagramyan as "Konigsberg in miniature",&lt;ref name=bagramyanp584&gt;Bagramyan, p.584&lt;/ref&gt; and was supported by fire from naval artillery and coastal batteries. After a stubborn defence, it was eventually stormed by units of 11th Guards Army, including the [[31st Guards Rifle Division]], on April 25, the town being cleared in around 12 hours.&lt;ref name=bagramyanp586&gt;Bagramyan, p.586&lt;/ref&gt; The last German position to fall was a battery commanded by Major-General [[Karl Henke]], which was overrun by the 16th Guards Rifle Corps on April 27.&lt;ref name=duffyp219-henke&gt;Duffy, p.219 (who misidentifies Major-General Henke as Major Henke)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Red Army claimed to have killed or taken prisoner 80,000 German troops during the operations in Sambia.&lt;ref name=bagramyanp588&gt;Bagramyan, p.588. This estimate seems high, but may include all prisoners taken on the Frische Nehrung.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remnants of IX Corps resisted on the Frische Nehrung to the end of the war, though the corps staff was removed to [[Bornholm]].

The headquarters of the Zemland Group of Forces later became the headquarters of the [[Baltic Military District]] on 9 July 1945.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Feskov et al 2004, Tomsk, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;
